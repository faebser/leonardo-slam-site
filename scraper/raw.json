Examining the roles of photomechanical and manual prints in avantgarde magazines, the author argues that relief prints played a key role in the circulation of Moholy-Nagy\u2019s work and served as a substitute for media that posed difficulties for small-scale production.", null, "This position article argues that the sciences of the artificial (artificial intelligence and artificial life) have a special relationship to art that is absent from much of science. Just as art is often a depiction or interpretation of nature, so are the algorithms in the sciences of the artificial. This observation is important because the discourse in these fields largely ignores the relevance of subjective resonance with nature to scientific progress. Yet progress is potentially stifled if scientists cannot discuss such resonance openly. To support this view, the author provides examples that illustrate how the subjective impression of such resonance led to novel encodings and algorithms in his own career.

To the extent mean temperature increases, insect populations accelerate deforestation. This alters climate via the loss of active carbon sequestration by live trees and increased carbon release from decomposing dead trees. A self-sustaining positive feedback loop can then emerge. Extensive field recordings demonstrate that bioacoustic communication plays a role in infestation dynamics and is likely to be a critical link in the feedback loop.

On the other hand, the mechanization of subjectivity carries the danger of simply reducing the human to the machine. The author argues that predominant artificial intelligence (AI) ap-proaches to modeling agents are based on an erasure of subjectivity analogous to that which appears when people are subjected to institutionalization. The result is agent behavior that is fragmented, depersonalized, lifeless and incomprehensible.

Relying on the idea that interaction and communication between entities of a system drive the emergence of structures that are more complex than the mere parts of that system, the authors propose to apply principles of complex system theory to the creation of VERBARIUM, an interactive, computer-generated and audience-participatory artwork on the Internet, and to test whether complexity can emerge within this system.", "This article consists of two sections: the first provides a brief overview of artificial-life art and entertainment software, some of the main products and their peculiarities; and the second describes one of the authors' artificial-life software products, called Life Spacies II, which was created between 1997 and 1999. This system consists of a web page that allows users to create artificial-life creatures by simply typing in text characters using a web page \u201ceditor.\u201d Written text is used as genetic code to model the creature's body. The body shape subsequently influences the creature's ability to move, which in turn determines the creature's behavior, survival and reproduction within the Life Spacies II environment.

These commentators follow a well-established literary and iconographic tradition that uses the language of empire and autocratic rule to describe the dominance of these carnivores over the rest of the natural world. The author analyzes the development of this paradigm of dominance from its inception to its latest articulations. In the author's opinion, the savage view of prehistoric nature has its roots in the philosophy of the Social Darwinists and their dreams of imperial rule over the non-Western societies they considered racially inferior.

The virtual environments that computers (particularly massively parallel ones) allow us to build can become the tools to perform the operation we need here, which is not analysis but synthesis. The discipline of artificial life serves as a good example of this approach, since its \u201cexperiments\u201d consist in unleashing populations of virtual animals (complete with their own \u201cDNA\u201d) into a simulated environment, where the emergent traits and behaviors that these populations generate can be studied over many generations.", null, "The author reviews the exhibition \u201cNew Art in China, Post-1989\u201d that opened at the University of Oregon Art Museum in December 1995 and is touring the United States until the end of 1997.

On the basis of an analysis of relations between the signified and the signifier in iconic artistic signs, the author shows that an iconic artistic sign has two fundamental levels of meaning: referential and formal. The first focuses attention on the signified object; the second, on the inventiveness and morphological complexity of its sign articulation.

The subsequent burgeoning of both astronomical knowledge and the new literary genre of science fiction increased the need for artists specializing in realistic depictions of outer space, other planets and spacecraft.

In the case of CD-ROMs, they also lead to a significant misconceptualization of the medium.

Digitalization produces intangible art, planned rather than crafted by the artist. The temporality, intangibility, and transience that mark art's ephemeralness are advanced through cyberspace, where the digital piece is placed on a network, downloaded, manipulated, and placed back on the network by others, sometimes simultaneously.

Do the metallic bodies armor the user/producer for the fear (delight) of a machine world, producing fear (delight) in the process? Is morphing a technique to evade, or explore, the identity crisis precipitated by awareness of cultural difference? What desires produce and are produced by the gravity-less perspective and movement of three-dimensional animation?

Comparison of these theories is presented as an illustration of the similarities between artistic and scientific approaches to creative and cognitive processes.

Here she reviews the steps she took to integrate computers with the center's curriculum and discusses four local artists who have been in the forefront of Hong Kong's digital art revolution.", null, "In the early days of computer graphics, artists had to learn programming in order to use the new technology. Today, when such a wide range of software packages runs on affordable hardware, one might ask why artists should continue to learn to program. While this question has been considered for many years, today even experienced artists are looking at the sophistication and affordability of current software and realizing that much of their programming efforts could amount to a proverbial reinvention of the wheel.

Beginning with two exhibitions of art by himself and other Atlanta artists from abusive backgrounds and using examples from his own work, including drawings, prints, paintings, constructions and performances, he shows how his imagery is related to his childhood experiences and feelings. These relations can be understood as visual analogues of the original abuse, its accompanying objects and gestures and the feelings stemming from it.", "This article draws attention to the critical role of electronic artists in the light of an examination of the differences between the First and Third Worlds. The author suggests that electronic artists are opening new venues for the use of computers as a human-centered technology by taking into account the complexity of human-machine relationships in a socio-cultural perspective. Artistic experiments are giving rise to combinations of the expressive potentials of human natural languages\u2014which extend over aesthetic, metaphoric, artistic, affective and moral domains\u2014and the objective, quantitative and procedural characteristics of computer-related languages.

The author surveys the history of such questions; lie claims that by attending to them, we can lay groundwork for a conscious art of evolution.", null, "The authors discuss some of the cognitive processes that underlie drawing skills. Experimental evidence from recent brain imaging studies reveals the physiological systems that underlie these cognitive processes. These studies show that information from the visual scene is fragmented into many largely independent components.

The process is likened to a planning or navigational task and is described through a concept borrowed from the Artificial Intelligence field: the idea of a state space within which a rule-based system operates. The concept of musical state space is postulated and the compositional process described in terms of moves through this space using different planning horizons. The importance of the short-term planning horizon in the creation of an individual style is highlighted, resulting in the definition of a \u201ccreativity corridor.\u201d An individual short-term planning style is thought to be an essential prerequisite to handling the vast musical state space in a meaningful way.

The geometry of the architectural space was the independent variable and its possible aesthetic-emotional effects constituted the dependent variable for the study. In the context of a 2 \u00d7 3 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) within-subjects factorial experimental design, scale models of rectangular, triangular and circular office interiors were manipulated.

Through discussion of this question the author suggests a universal concept of symmetry as a social theory of perspective that is oriented by deepening human understanding. By applying these ideas to the relations of nations, he proposes a special concept of symmetry as a perspective to prevent wars by means of a balance. In the context of this vision of symmetry the author describes his proposals for two monuments of peace: a Berlin memorial Br\u00fccken des Lebens (Bridges of Life) and an earth memorial Gro\u00dfe Konf\u00f6deration im Kreuz (Great Confederation in the Cross).", "The author outlines her experiences as a holographer, from her physics studies in 1981 at the University of Vermont, to her graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to the building of her own laboratory.

In the twentieth century these traditions have been stretched to a breaking point, opening new avenues of artistic exploration. The author here explores the grammatical tool of visual consonance, using mathematics as a mechanism for the generation and composition of abstract materials. The idea of form and content as inseparable aspects of Western musical practice is applied to visual art. The golden section is used as a continuous thread throughout the discussion, and several works are analyzed. Also included are a historical survey and a sampling of the author's work.", "The author discusses his interest in the Lippmann hologram, whereby the image is reconstructed with a white light, and his research in the analysis of imaging characteristics as well as in the development of new types of recording materials.

These developments demand a thorough-going ethical practise and a fundamental reformulation of accepted notions of creativity, consciousness and natural and social organization. Outlining key concepts and discoveries in twentieth-century science and philosophy, the author draws attention to the existence of a strong organismic or process tradition in Western culture that is re-emerging in various fields of the physical, biological and social sciences. The author asserts that such a change in science and technology will have global ramifications for humans and that it is the amplification of these insights to which artists should turn their attention.", null, "The artist describes his art-making technique, which combines the use of handwork and textile-industry machinery to create \u2018soft paintings\u2019.

The work goes beyond the boundaries of a conventional exhibition of painting and sculpture in various ways. The artist parodies the analytical methods of anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists and art historians. He presents work patinated to suggest antiquity and emphasizes deception, obscurities and satire, strategies aimed at stimulating audience involvement. In contrast to the convention of exhibiting painting and sculpture in passive environments, contrived to eliminate interferences and to foster atmospheres of contemplative acquiescence, the exhibition environment described here was designed to heighten ambiguity and dubiety by alternately strengthening and weakening the credibility of the invented civilization. The disruptive effect of planned interference is mollified by the cohesive use of sound and music, compiled and composed to function as an element unifying the whole experience.", "The author probes the limitations of the body and discusses ways of extending the body's capabilities through technology, such as his Third Hand mechanism. Prosthetic devices, robotic structures and body-machine symbiosis are part of this unique performance artist's vision of our future.", "The author presents a personal software program that enables artists to create environments through various methods, some of which, such as perspective, are traditional.

He developed the conviction that significant art could be made by using the most elementary media\u2014a conviction confirmed by the history of art. Establishing certain basic constraints, he began to draw a series of crow-quill black-and-white images, inspired in part by Picasso illustrations and also by mathematical coordinate plots. He named the new art forms \u2018schemas\u2019 because they reminded him of schematic diagrams. The author analyzes the elements of his schemas, using examples culled from the hundreds he has created over the years, and shows how they evolved into color images.

Could the sexual body be represented as an ontologically transparent skin through which art and science are mutually visible? These questions are posed by the author in the form of cross-disciplinary works: original biological-visual research into the development of the genitals in the human embryo, 3D models, drawings, videos, paintings on the body and didactic lecture-performances. The works draw upon disparate fields of knowledge\u2014linguistics, psychoanalysis, the histories of visual art and biological science, the subjectivity of the artist\u2014to propose alternative terms for the construction of sex, sexuality and gender during this time of crisis in sexual difference as it stands at the intersection of feminism, science, art and politics.", null, null, null, null, "Formalist and relativist approaches for the study of aesthetics are criticised here: formalism, for its neglect of contextual factors, and relativism, for its inability to incorporate in a satisfactory way the object of aesthetic attention.

The author suggests an original method of classifying the arts that makes it possible to simultaneously graph both the expanding \u2018universe of the arts\u2019 and the centripetal tendencies that characterize the integrity of the arts system. He discusses the types of interactions that occur between the different kinds of art forms, as well as the inevitability of strengthening synthetic trends in the artistic culture. The author's analysis of contemporary technical means of audiovisual communication, together with his system of classifying the arts, is conducted in light of S. M.

The magnitude of \u03b2 controls the sweep of the curve, and the closer this angle \u03b2 is to 90\u00b0 the tighter the spiral. For the Nautilus pompilius illustrated in this paper, the average growth-ratio of radius vectors, for \u03b8 = 90\u00b0, is in the order of 1:1.3158, which yields a constant angle \u03b2 of about 80\u00b0.", null, null, "The author describes her process art. Four independent artworks are documented, three of which are phases of development toward a major interactive production.

He has painted over 100 spheres ranging in size from 7 inches to 7\u00bd feet in diameter. Most of these globes hang and turn from ceiling motors. In this paper the author explains his logic of moving from a traditional flat straight-line perspective (one- to three-point perspectives), to a flat curved-line perspective (four- and five-point perspectives), to a spherical perspective where each line looks straight or curved depending on its location in relation to the observer. Grids assist greatly in showing the logic of moving from the traditional perspective to this new dimension on the spherical canvas.", null, "After introducing himself and describing his first meeting with Leonardo founding editor Frank Malina, the author reminisces about his 12 years as assistant editor on Frank's staff in Paris.

Daniel Sandin's invention, a video synthesizer that artists could build themselves, thereby facilitating the autonomous production of artworks, is discussed. Videotapes generated on the Sandin Image Processor have been exhibited internationally and have received numerous festival prizes.

The usefulness of the model was tested with well-known paintings selected on the basis of their level of departure from realistic representation.", "One of the main functions of the computer is the graphic display of results. Through the use of the computer, the visualization of mathematical relations can lead to new ways of comprehending mathematics. In addition, the resulting images can be remarkably attractive.

At the same time, use of computers in structural musicology, folkloristics and psychoacoustics produced some fundamental works that revealed new ways of looking at musical perception and hence changed the way modern composers looked at musical form. The author also provides brief portraits of 15 Soviet computer composers and meditates on the future of computer music.", null, null, "The author argues that telecommunications constitutes a new, postindustrial international dimension and that the nature of artists' work in this medium differs radically from that of most earlier art forms. This paper provides an overview of artists' work with telecommunications systems and gives a brief history of some significant events of the last 10 years. The creative development of the medium by artists is described, and an emergent new paradigm of interactive work is discussed in terms of cultural theories of communication.", null, null, null, "The introduction of visual, digital technology and electronic media over the last 20 years constitutes a fundamental and dramatic change in the disciplines of design, according to this author, who posits that the nature of this change is little understood by academies of art and design.

In this paper, the author discusses the perception, illusion and reality of movement as they relate to both humans and machines. Using Zeno's paradox of motion to explore these issues, she demonstrates how, through repeatable and predictable motion, robots can enhance the study of various aspects of choreographed motion and of the phenomenon of motion itself.", "The author views space exploration as a human activity that transcends science and technology. He suggests that the ecological objective to save the earth is a beautiful and moral mission in which the arts should play a central role. Thus, aeronautics includes planetary consciousness; ethics is aesthetics.

Extending the experience of this internal channel to the wider context of exterior telecommunications networks is a natural progression leading to the concept of a global, oracular, telecommunications net, which in turn reflects certain key mythological patterns.", "The author sketches his development as an artist and inventor, specifically related to his Palestinian background. Early work on Arabic type design, on an instrument for stereoscopic drawing and on an instrument to aid perspective drawing is discussed and technically summarized. The artist's watercolor paintings, which reflect his experiences of war, the loss of his homeland and life as an exile in Japan, are also discussed, as is his invention of a device to trace the position of the sun's shadow and various optical devices. Finally, the author documents the development of a new theory to explain the diffraction of waves and a proposed method to cancel this effect.", "The author narrates the story of L. S. Termen, the Soviet inventor who created the world's first electronic musical instrument. Details about Termen's life are given, and his inventions in various fields of technology, primarily in electronic music, are discussed.

The pleasure of discovery animates this search for a distillation toward the purest statement of form. In the second phase, the leap from outside to inside becomes the conversion of lively and complex figurative and mechanical elements into a peopleless world, re-emerging newly abstract as a mini-universe of disembodied skull, spine, heart and bone shapes, and as an array of gears, cogs and wheels that blends with geometrical and numerical shapes. Color is subject to a parallel process of reduction, playing an integrating role in forging the unique identity that gives definition to the painting. Form and color fuse in attaining the below-the-surface life of the figure and the machine, thereby introducing new pictorial elements and stimulating new visual ideas\u2014in essence, a system of symbolic abstraction.", null, "\u2018Painting with light\u2019, through the use of lasers as monochromatic, coherent light sources, has become a reality for artistic expression in this century.

The author discusses various theories and experiments designed to study the relationship between observation and creativity. Research involving parapsychology, quantum theory and animal experiments is discussed.", null, "For sculptors wishing to utilize luminosity in their work, neon has many virtues and possibilities. The author sees himself as a generalist with specialties. For the past several years, his specialties have been primarily concerned with luminism and kineticism. Because of his involvement with luminism, he has developed considerable expertise with electric gas discharge tubes, or \u2018neon\u2019, resulting not only in aesthetic but technical innovations as well. He describes here his portable neon fabrication system, which has made possible projects and installations previously thought too difficult or unfeasible to pursue.", null, "Telematic art in Australia can be contextualized within the historical debate concerning the siting of European settlers geographically and psychologically on the \u2018new\u2019 continent. Telematic art offers new resolutions to complex ethical and aesthetic questions involving space. Electronic space can be compared to the \u2018mental maps\u2019 and paintings of Australian Aboriginals. From this comparison, it is possible to envisage how positive new mental maps could be provided for urbanized Australians in their relations with each other and with the rest of the world.", null, "The author grew up in the artistic milieu of Europe before World War II; he traveled widely and lived for many years in Bolivia. In this article he describes his encounter with the world of science. The intellectual challenges, the hostilities and the frustrations, mingled with memories of the Bolivian jungle, led him to search beyond conventions and concepts of art and science for a truce between those conflicting factions, an integrating attitude, without pretense or mystification. Our dependent state in this universe and our present ecological predicament warrant a greater openness and an inviting attitude toward the natural world in our creative endeavors. The author discusses his work and sees it as a series of heuristic experiments.", null, "The versatile resources of a powerful computer in combination with a superior method of 3-D projection provide the essential basis for a unique approach to multimedia art oriented to a highly integrated synesthesia of image and sound in space.

At present they are weapons to the extent that their keepers intend to use them as weapons. In addition, they are products of advanced technology, sources of economic profit and emblems of both security and evil. They can also be art. This note explores their potential as art.", "This paper discusses the role of the prompt in telecommunications in terms of its antiphonal, sculptural and theatrical characteristics. It shows how artists have used the prompt, understood in this manner, to posit the existence of a virtual world that can be experienced and manipulated by users who are encouraged to create virtual identities. The paper concludes with a vision of the potential for art in telecommunications.", "The author provides a theoretical analysis of the exhibition and the show program at the Light and Music festival held 20\u201330 September 1987, in Kazan, USSR. He considers problems of art, science and technology, with special reference to musical-kinetic art, in Russia and the Soviet Union since the beginning of the twentieth century. Attention is devoted to nontraditional, experimental artistic forms that make active use of modern technology. Concrete examples are given from the festival program, which included works of leading Soviet experimentalists.", null, "The author discusses a personal expert computer system driven by his own \u2018software art\u2019. The software (with appropriate hardware) generates paintings and drawings that resemble the mature work of the artist's pre-electronic period, containing brush strokes that exhibit spontaneous qualities. The author outlines the prerequisite understanding necessary for writing the code, aspects of the software and hardware implementation, the biological analogue (epigenesis) and salient questions raised by the new procedure.", "A feedback model is presented to account for sigmoidal growth. Such a model, while making moot the question of cause and effect, may account for correlations in art-historical phenomena. Sigmoidal growth is characterized by initial slow growth, followed by rapid growth and eventually limited by saturation. Both behaviorism and cybernetics are based on a feedback model; thus, it is proposed here that the perception of historical \u2018movements', \u2018periods\u2019 and \u2018styles\u2019 is the result of sigmoidal phenomena, which in turn are related to feedback mechanisms.", "This investigation examines the degree to which notational integration of the two media of music and dance is possible. A distinction is made between the interaction of music and dance, and the practical issues of the composer/choreographer relationship, with a tentative classification of both. The authors then describe their computer-based compositional and choreographic system, NUNTIUS, which provides direct data transfer and interpretation (structural patterns or processes) between the two media.", "The author discusses the creation of a core curriculum of interdisciplinary study for artists implemented at the University of Michigan and adapted by the University of Hawaii to replace a traditional art foundation. Addressing the cognitive development of students, the author describes Perception and Notation as a series of three studio seminars\u2014Light, Space and Time\u2014that stress the fundamental relatedness of principles for all visual artists.", "If we choose a few points on the plane, call these points \u2018regents\u2019 and assign to each a color, then we can create a pattern simply by coloring every other point with the color of the regent closest to it. We need not use the ordinary concept of distance; also we can vary the place and color of the regents and the method of coding and printing the information. The author discusses possible extensions of this method and connections with Frank Dietrich's data-particle theory.", null, null, null, null, "The author presents his current work in concrete and neon, two apparently paradoxical materials, which he has been using since 1984. After placing his work in a general context, he then explains the evolution of his creative process. He defines the specific technical qualities of concrete and neon, describing both the contradiction and the interaction between the two as well as their relation to space and their influence on the environment. He considers works in concrete and neon to be both images of the modern world and reflections of an ancient one.", "The author explains how telecommunications-based art breaks new ground by using technology to create completely new contexts for art. He identifies a series of issues that must be addressed in order to strengthen this art form: the need for clarity about conceptual rationales for using telecommunications in artwork, the need for attention to the sensual format in which information appears, the importance of editing and craft, and the appropriateness of producing local versus global works in some situations. The article then introduces artistic opportunities for working with related technologies that are converging with telecommunications: artificial intelligence, groupware, telepresence and virtual worlds.", "An algorithm based on square arrays of positive integers, which was created for the purpose of constructing visually appealing designs for carpets and rugs, is described by the authors.

After a brief overview of the history of Hungarian pedagogical models, the authors focus on topics such as innovations in technological education, a design competition for children and young adults, interdisciplinary curricula for primary schools, a national project to modernize instruction in aesthetics and environmental education projects sponsored by the Hungarian Ministry of Architecture and Urban Planning.", "Artist Kennan C. Herrick describes his evolution from electronics engineer to artist over the course of 20 years' work in making kinetic and neon art. He discusses several of his kinetic and neon artworks in terms of his motivations for making them, what effects he wanted to achieve, how they function and some of the materials and fabrication processes that went into them.", "The author investigates creativity and intelligence in the process of computer-assisted image making. Exploring the meaning of creativity, he proposes the use of standard methods of symbolic computation to model the creative process. This conceptual approach is compared to other inclinations toward digital media that an artist might exhibit. Proceeding from a discussion of how the manipulation of symbols and processes often reveals new underlying concepts, he provides a few examples of machine-based art that have their roots in knowledge-based decision making.", null, "In September 1989, St\u00e9phan Barron and Sylvia Hansmann drove along the Greenwich Meridian from the English Channel to the Mediterranean Sea. With a car fax machine they regularly sent images and texts to fax machines in eight locations in Europe. In this way they introduced a new representation of line\u2014one of the first symbols of humanity\u2014that included time, space and imagination. Lines aims at inducing a planetary consciousness, a technological humanism. The project explores new measures of time and space and contributes to a postmodern and ecological sensibility.", "This article describes the emergence of a new science based upon the empirically and intuitively perceived unity of an evolving nature in which all conscious beings partake. The author suggests that knowing is at once an acknowledgment of nature's unity and, at the same time, an active participation in the creation and shaping of reality. A discussion of the ways in which these principles provide the possibility for the unification of human experience and creativity follows.", "The author describes how, dissatisfied with two-dimensional art, he began making objects\u2014often kinetic\u2014assembled from found organic and artificial materials, artificial limbs, polyurethane, machinery and motors. He sees his art as a form of alchemy, finding methods of converting worthless found materials into value and associative power, or as a kind of Robinson Crusoe attempt to reconstruct the process of technological progress with his own hands.", null, "The idea that particles make atoms, atoms make molecules, and molecules make visible matter\u2014matter that lives and thinks\u2014is basic to a scientific understanding of the universe. While working with hexagons and pondering this hierarchy, the author discovered two surprising circular arrangements of these levels that may shed light on how we think when using these concepts.", "This article examines the role that theories of photographic cinema play in the criticism of digital cinema.

Their ideas have applicability to specific aspects of digital cinema, including the manipulation of illusory space, discrete and explicit control of cinematic elements, the transformation of world spaces into screen space and the role of realistic imagery in determining the content of a cinematic work. Parallels can be drawn between the ideas of these theorists, most of whom wrote during the infancy of photographic cinema, on the developing state of film and that of current digital cinema.", "The author reports the results of applying a new empirical methodology, and related psychological constructs, to portraiture in order to elucidate issues of representation, schema application, abstraction and distortion in the creative process, as it unfolds in vivo. In this exploratory micro-analysis, professional and skilled amateur portraitists were videotaped while they drew portraits under six different experimental conditions, defined by time allotted to complete the work and the presence versus memory-recall of the models during the drawing phase. The amount of attention devoted to 22 different areas of the face and abstraction and distortion in the rendering of facial features were computed from the videotapes and statistically analyzed. Also, the portraits were rated in terms of pleasingness, interestingness and the degree of abstraction and distortion. Among other findings, the artists used fewer strokes and rendered more abstract portraits when they drew with a model present than when they drew from memory, and the portraits rated more abstract were also rated more pleasing and interesting.", "The process known in art as anamorphosis or anamorphic projection is at once a confirmation of and a challenge to the rules of linear perspective and the conventions of representation. In this first part of a two-part series of articles, the author discusses art-historical and psychoanalytic literature in regard to a role for anamorphosis beyond that of perspective theory. In this discussion, particular emphasis is placed upon the viewer actively observing the anamorphosis, introducing what the author describes as the \u2018eccentric observer\u2019. The second part of this article, to follow in the next regular issue of Leonardo, will detail modern uses of anamorphosis, with emphasis on contemporary artworks.", "The majority of designers in applied disciplines seem unaware that by using computer-assisted technology they are committing themselves to a fundamental and fairly rapid paradigm change. The cliched quality of much work being produced is a consequence of too many digital trinkets being employed before the potential of the new medium as a thing in itself has evolved. The solution, if any, is an examination of the intrinsic aesthetic nature of this new medium before we are distracted by user-friendly productivity enhancers.", null, "The author describes Sculptor, a three-dimensional computer modelling system that allows the use of sculptural methods for the construction of objects. These objects can be subsequently realised as physical sculptures through the use of a contour-slicing routine, though the major use of the system has been in the production of computer images of three-dimensional \u2018scenes\u2019. The origins, structure and usage of the system are described, followed by a discussion of the author's personal exploration of its possibilities.", "The author views tapestry design both as a creative endeavor and as a mathematical exploration of the process of forming an image. The fundamental language of drawing is embodied in the techniques of the craft of fiber art weaving. Good design in tapestry is an art of ingenious tactics, requiring an appreciation of art history, geometry and the unique characteristics of the chosen materials.", null, "The Digital Art Exchange (DAX Group) of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a diverse group of artists, engineers and researchers collaborating on various telematic projects. The group's intent is to create thought bundles'\u2014cultural probes that connect people throughout the world via global networks. In order to see the electronic age for what it is, we must create a new paradigm and learn to deal with the altered consciousness resulting from the rapid development of technology. Further, the immediacy of telecommunications can take on an irony and intensity when planned projects collide with actual world events that are transmitted on a global scale.", "The author reviews a transcription of Xenakis's \u2018thesis defense\u2019 for the \u2018Doctorat d'Etat\u2019 at the Sorbonne in 1976 and finds it a welcome and essential addition to the literature documenting the composer's ideas. Each dialogue transcribed introduces a different thinker and colleague of Xenakis, and each focuses on a different realm of Xenakis's compositional and aesthetic philosophy. The informality and interdisciplinary nature of the discussions contributes new and valuable insights into Xenakis's work. Xenakis's dialogue with Messiaen is of particular interest, because of Xenakis's extraordinary rapport with his former teacher, and because of the unusual candor with which these two composers spoke.", null, "The author discusses some of the written correspondence between M. C. Escher and Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt, as well as examples of Escher's correspondence with others that Roosevelt assembled as a collector of Escher memorabilia. This collection offers explanations of Escher's methods of print reproduction and reveals the sources of some of his ideas for his circle limit reproductions, symmetric designs and \u2018impossible\u2019 figures. The Cornelius Roosevelt Collection is in the National Gallery of Art Library in Washington, D.C.", null, "The author explores old and new myths about developing media technologies and their effects on changing traditions in art and science. Combining personal experience with ideas from selected futuring and media literature, the author fashions, through metaphor and models, a philosophical, conceptual and practical basis for training the artist of the future. The essay concludes with a description of arts-and-technology programs at the University of South Florida and visual examples of work done in the programs.", "Computer imagery is fraught with divers conundrums and paradoxes associated with the fact that it is both abstract and concrete. It confounds familiar ways of understanding appearance and reality. We can begin to resolve the perplexity by using the idea of recursion to contrast digital imaging with picturing. It is particularly useful to explore the concept of an interface and to study its role in the imaging system. Digital images cannot be understood outside the context of the complete interactive system in which they occur.", null, null, "This article is an exposition of composition theory, the cognitive theory of processes of music composition. The text is in three parts. In the first part, a compositional task environment typical for the mid-1980s is discussed, to demonstrate the heterogeneity of tools a composer needs when creating a musical work. The second part presents a written lecture-demonstration of a compositional process for producing a score for saxophone solo. In the third part, an abstract model of compositional problem-solving is proposed using the blackboard paradigm from artificial intelligence research. The point of the article is to show that, far from inhibiting compositional intuition, the computer program has become an indispensable alter ego for composers who care to work systematically. The article proposes a framework for studies in composition theory as a discipline based on artificial intelligence.", "Our species transmits acquired and inherited information from generation to generation. This doubly contradicts nature. The Second Principle of Thermodynamics states that information contained within nature tends to be forgotten. Living organisms contradict that principle by preserving and transmitting genetic information. They constitute a memory in defiance of the entropy of nature. Mendel's biological law states that acquired information cannot be transmitted from organism to organism. Our species contradicts that law by having an elaborate cultural memory, progressively storing acquired information to which successive generations have access. This double negation of nature, although only temporary, constitutes the human condition. Human dignity, which distinguishes us from all other known beings, can be defined as the fact that we have both a genetic and a cultural memory, that we are \u2018historical beings\u2019. Human dignity will acquire new meaning as electronic memories radically transform our cultural memory. This article considers some aspects of that transformation.", "The author examines the effects of contemporary science and technology on individuals and the psychological and cultural mutations that can result, ranging from the physical dematerialization of people to the continuity existing between their psyches and their electronic devices. Within a framework of interrelationships between art and society, he develops a hypothesis about the role of the artist in society.", null, "Images are children's first language; scribbling and drawing are the means by which they first represent the world. To children, art is total communication. The Logo Telecommunications project was designed to look at ways through which children could bring together images, symbols and words to communicate concepts over distance using the computer as a tool. The project is concerned with developing a creative interface between children and technology by investigating both how children process personal information and imagery through electronic media and how telecommunications affects children's perceptions of internal and external space. The Logo Telecommunications project broke through the isolation that children so often experience in inner-city schools. In doing so it sparked new ways of seeing and doing, dynamically widening the dimensions of children's learning environment.", "New forms of art and technology are frequently cast in the mode of old forms, just as other aspects of material and symbolic culture have been. Only when these new forms become available to the larger population can they affect cultural patterns of maintenance and change. The author traces the evolution from alphanumeric hardcopy, static and dynamic screen images, through objects and events that are not screen-based, to dynamic, interactive, multisensory output. The effects of origins and prior practices in both technology and art on form, content, material, technique, meaning and purpose of computer graphics are explored. Speculation regarding possible and probable futures are raised.", null, null, "The author finds Von Gunden's research on this influential composer to be unusually thorough, citing the wealth of detail the book contains on the factors that have influenced Johnston's work. The book describes both spiritual influences and the effects of Johnston's exposure to other experimental composers. The author goes on to praise Von Gunden's open-minded attitude towards Johnston's early compositions. While acknowledging the difficulty of writing about a colleague, he suggests that Von Gunden's discussion of certain major works could have provided a more extensive evaluation of their importance.", "The author describes his personal experience teaching technology to artists. It appears necessary to participate rather than \u2018teach\u2019, yet it is also necessary to provide goals and methods to guide student development. This apparent conflict is complicated by issues that stem from the conceptual conflicts between the arts and sciences. Perceptions of artistic achievement and creativity can easily become confused with the challenge of mastering the methods and media. This article seeks to clarify some of these problems and offers some suggestions to instructors working in this field.", "Throughout history, attempts have been made to associate music (sound) and visual arts (space) with respect to both their figurative and abstract components. In this article the author describes his personal attempt to transpose the basic rules of music (rhythm, notes and sol-fa) into painting on a formal basis: times and bars are transposed into spatial elements (lengths, angles or surfaces); notes are transposed into lengths proportional to their frequencies. This formal basis acts as a score, providing a structure for abstract pictures that are \u2018interpretations\u2019 of pieces of music. The bars are placed on basic lines. These lines transpose the time needed for listening to the piece. Shapes of the basic lines and colours attributed to the notes follow rules of interpretation. Up to now, the aim of his research essentially has been to interpret classical and romantic music in painting.", null, "The mathematical characterization of patterns in Pascal's triangle is useful and can be achieved by a variety of brute-force computations, but sometimes at a cost of the loss of an intuitive feeling for the regularities and irregularities in the structure. The graphic and mathematical approach described here reveals a visually striking and intricate class of patterns that make up a family of regular fractal networks known as Sierpinski gaskets.

She discusses the story and structure of Uncle Roger and describes how the story was told and published in an online community. In the conclusion she discusses the future of computer literature.", "Computers are transforming existing art forms and allowing new kinds of art forms to be developed. Because the computer is primarily a machine for processing information, not a machine for making objects, it provides a malleable medium that provides the artist with a large variety of tools for manipulating sense data. The work that contains the result of the artist's creativity is the software and the data, not any particular image or output produced using that software. The ultimate goal of artmaking using computers, in this light, is not to create art objects but to create dynamic art subjects, to produce families of aesthetically interesting outputs, or art performances, which are as different from each other as possible within the constraints of the software. This situates computer art within the larger context of the study and development of artificial life. To create significant artworks of this type, it will be necessary to improve the computer's capacity to be an autonomous artmaking subject; this will require the extension of the computer's senses, the expansion of its capabilities, and means for the computer to provide sensory inputs to the human nervous system and to other computers.", "The author describes how colors of some familiar objects and scenes shifted when viewed with one of his eyes after a lens implant, compared to the other eye without implant. Estimates of the shifts are described with common color names. Some of the shifts were spectacular. Variations in the spectral transmission of the lens are believed responsible for the shifts.

Pictorial communication is seen to have two directions: from the picture to the viewer and from the viewer to the picture. The design of interactive instruments using pictorial formats requires an understanding of the manipulative, perceptual and cognitive limitations of their viewers. This understanding can be used to compensate for systemic errors made when interpreting pictures.", "The author posits that students' fear of science would be lessened if science education were combined with art education. To further such a combination, the author curated several \u201cArt and Science\u201d exhibitions and gave scientific demonstrations on art-related techniques.

What differences in resolution and dynamic range (bit-depth) can they see? Groups of art historians were asked to rate a series of displayed test images; the results show how participants' responses compared with the actual range of image quality. Practical implications of viewers' perceptions are discussed.", "In 13 letters to Sonia Sheridan, the author discusses his experiments with wet and dry electrostatic printing. His topics include the setup of a Haloid Xerox system, Haloid versus Electrofax prints, indirect electrostatics versus silver photography, negative images with Xerox plates, halftone screening, zinc papers and dry development, and intaglio press and pressure fusing.", "Images of artworks can be stored in media that preserve different characteristics of the original. Differences exist in the extent to which we can preserve color, three-dimensionality, surface texture, fine structure, tonal gradations, temporal variations and other characteristics that lend uniqueness to individual artworks. Usually, we are willing to sacrifice some of these characteristics in exchange for the permanence and recoverability offered by storage media. Thus, a color slide (diapositive), which is a common medium for storing images of artworks, compromises all of the above properties to different extents but is nevertheless considered useful for the archival properties it offers for images of artworks. Digital storage media used in conjunction with computers offer new opportunities and demand new compromises in storing art images. An unusual challenge is offered by the possibility of providing intelligence to a computer. The authors make clear the sense in which we may ascribe intelligence to the computer and how this may be used to \u2018perceive\u2019 the image of an artwork. The computer then uses its knowledge of the artwork with respect to a large class of such works not only for archival storage but also to achieve economy in the use of the storage medium. The authors illustrate the achievement of storage economy as much as tens of thousands of times greater than storage without intelligence. The intelligence is provided to the computer as syntactic descriptions of classes of artworks. The syntactic descriptions incorporate insight from the art historian, critic or artist who uses innovative tools like shape grammars to provide the computer with a small part of the intelligence that the educated human viewer brings to the perception of the artwork.", "The author demonstrates that artists not only have painted various meteorological elements accurately but also have placed these elements in their proper relation to one another.

It intends to introduce the subject of computerised visualisation for scientific purposes into a wider debate, to show the diversity of issues involved\u2014scientific, cultural and philosophical\u2014and to build a context in which they can be critiqued. The author seeks to show the variety of scientific imaging and its influences on scientific knowledge; as both experiments and results are increasingly expressed in terms of imagery, the image assumes an integrity of its own and the object to which it refers becomes obscured. This leads to a shift of focus away from abstract theory as the embodiment of knowledge to the ascension of an allegorical image-based science with computer graphics as its natural language.", "In the process of experimenting with copier technology, the author became aware of energies, such as heat and electrostatics, that could be exploited by artists.

He uses the way we visually interpret images presented on a flat surface through physiological and psychological depth cues to introduce the paradox of a flat holographic surface displaying a three-dimensional image. In presenting a diagrammatic explanation for the space displayed by holograms, he focusses on the technical developments of the holographic process, the viewing zones generated by holographic plates and the restrictions imposed during the recording process.", "The author describes City Portraits, a telecommunications project in which artists, students and teachers from 11 universities on three continents use documents sent by their correspondents abroad to construct portraits of cities they have never seen. Through the exchange of images, the project's participants explore the workings of their imaginations and discover their home towns (and themselves) as others perceive them. The city itself is the central theme, reflecting the structure of the exchange.", "Because art students often tend to be reluctant to follow any set pattern except their own, the author devised a number of methods to reveal to her students the joys of interaction.

Looking for the specificity of its artistic expression and adopting an analytical attitude, he soon found himself confronted by a limit. In 1978, his work reflected the idea that the photo of a white sheet of paper is a white sheet of paper; the white sheet of paper is what it is\u2014both the photo and the object. In opposition to photography regarded as a tool of the mass media and used as a convincing advertising image, he has explored its meditative, silent aspect. Despite the technical characteristics of this medium, he learned of and joined the tradition that considers silence a creative force. Sketching the general lines of this tradition, he tries to show that the silence in aesthetic contemplation does not mean an escape from the world but rather an opening for conversation.", "Within the Perception and Notation curriculum is a course called Light.

The study of art history is a common requirement in most studio art programs. Similarly, photography students are usually introduced to the history of that medium early in their training. This is not always the case with holography, which often emphasizes technique and process. To study the various stereoscopic formats of the past is to understand previous uses for some of the effects that characterize holography. An understanding of why these earlier imaging systems fell out of use can help the student holographer avoid the same pitfalls. The goal of this essay is to increase awareness of the need to get past the novelty of the medium. Only then can the student of holography come to terms with the expressive potential of depth, color, movement and parallax that defines the holographic image.", "The author describes his discovery that people making freely improvised sounds create a form of tribal music that can be played by every human being on earth. That discovery led him to stage a series of projects that drew participation from hundreds of people in dozens of countries. All these projects were open to everyone, flexible in size, open to all sounds, organically and spontaneously directed, and professionally recorded as conceptual art and documentary music for distribution, evaluation and enjoyment. The author's intent in his work is to transcend traditional geographic and cultural divisions in the world in order to develop art forms that extend the limits of participation, art and telecommunications.", null, "This article records the changes that have taken place over the last few years both in the author's beliefs about artistic creation and in the style of his works. Through an analysis of the content and form of several of his paintings, the author seeks to show how such changes can affect an artist's form of expression.

The artist also discusses the improvisational techniques necessary to his involvement in this relatively new and evolving medium, and the technological and conceptual considerations of holographic art and high-tech art in general.", null, "The artist describes his use of the microcomputer to explore the nature of images he has created in the visual arts. He explains how he used a new IBM authoring language called HANDY to create a wide variety of images that later became a basis for drawings in colored pencils and black-and-white lithographs.

In the notations, the formal and even aesthetic aspects are as important as the transmission of \u2018objective\u2019 data. The author stresses the importance of developing analog codes for temporal configurations, i.e. codes that transcend intradisciplinary confines; he tries to show that the procedures described in the article may make a contribution in this direction and indicates how they may be employed in the classroom.", null, "From Rodin to the present, sculptors have had difficulty finding a vocabulary for public art that is not only valid as sculpture and true to the spirit of their times but also acceptable to the general public. An urban neighborhood association commissioned the author's first public sculpture, a set of boundary markers built as a political organizing tool. Over the course of building 11 public sculptures, he has observed that putting the skills of a sculptor to work to meet the needs of a group of people who use a public space is a useful way to approach public art. The community's ideas can serve as \u2018found objects\u2019, sources for the sculpture. The author has been able to explore in large-scale work some of the same ideas as those in his non-representational studio sculpture.

The patterns evolve and prevail under conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium in that there is continuous influx of physical or chemical energy. Due to this openness, they are considered model cases for living systems in biology. The dynamics of pattern evolution is governed by nonlinear interactions. In spatial concentration distributions, several geometrical shapes predominate. Their structural elements are singular points, branching points, bands, circles, spirals, helices. These elements and compositions thereof are also found in biology. The authors discuss the significance of regulatory principles in the creation of spatial complexity, which often reveal remarkable aesthetic aspects.", "The author expresses his preferences for \u2018comprehensive\u2019 computer-assisted composition programs, for an experimental attitude, and for using specific computer capabilities such as the production of random events and of multiple variants of the same work. He briefly discusses the aesthetics behind MP1, his computer program for musical composition, and then presents some basic features of the program.

The idea is supported by views taken from the fields of phenomenology and information science. Thoughts about how perception is being altered are expressed, and material for the understanding of computer imagery is provided.", null, "The concept of form, related both to perception and to art, is one of the more exciting concepts that human consciousness has created. This ancient topic has received a new impetus from research on the automated recognition of form, closely linked to artificial intelligence.

This paper considers the question of form chiefly with respect to human perception and human affectivity, i.e. with respect to visual art.", null, null, "Both contemporary digital photography and analog photography of the nineteenth century place mechanical representation at the service of the imagination. These media are part of a perceptual continuum that began with the Industrial Revolution and reflect its mechanical and scientific extension of the human ability to create a visual microcosm. A capacity for literal mimesis also existed at the juncture of art and science of that period. This interdisciplinary relationship gave rise to a belief that a description of reality was a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of objective \u2018truth\u2019. Thus, from the beginnings of photography, the objectivity of the photograph was often conflated with the structure of the reality it rendered. Although digital photography is like its nineteenth-century predecessor in this regard, its origins in computer science and its links to the graphic arts and constructivism also help to define its content and style.", null, "The main theme of this article is a new vision of art using holography. The author criticizes the solidity of objects and explains the reasoning behind the need for spatiotemporal art.

The system analyzes viewers' responses to different combinations of graphic variables and uses this information to iteratively display, test and refine pictures most attractive to the viewer. Images are created using empirically developed variables, which include number, size, variety and position of picture elements, along with color, complexity and regularity. Based on several graphic features defined by psychologists, art historians, and designers, these variables also relate to computer-graphics generation methods. The reliability of a prototype system, the Adaptive Graphics Analyzer, is supported by viewers' preference ratings for over 1,500 image stimuli. The authors hope that findings from this system eventually will be incorporated into theories of aesthetics and effective visual communication.", "People who work at creating holographic art have to overcome many obstacles prior to meeting with even a modicum of success. They must usually do so with a minimum of outside help, experts being rather scarce. A mountain of equipment and a substantial facility and budget are required for the more ambitious undertakings. These obstacles have not deterred a few particularly hardy pioneer types, such as Paula Dawson of Sydney, Australia. She tackles life-size objects routinely and unrelentingly on a scale that some would claim to be impossible. The technical achievement is secondary to the artistic messages in her work, but the scale is necessary to properly make the statement. This paper applauds the hardy few who have reached their goals and gives encouragement to those with yet unfulfilled dreams.", "Both science and art are products of the intellectual life of a society and may answer the same questions from different vantage points. An example of parallel work in science and art is Penman's studies in biology and physics and Nettleship's sculpture. Penman studies subcellular structure, which organizes the biochemical events within cells. Nettleship makes sculpture in which he examines form development and relationships between interior and surface. The main points of comparison in their work are (1) the visual similarity between the observed cell structure and the forms of Nettleship's sculpture, (2) the study of surfaces that are integral parts of interiors and (3) a conviction that organizing principles exist that govern the construction of interior cellular structures and sculptural form. Together their work suggests a reassertion of the central place of form in diverse disciplines.", "If someday a computer that achieves a high level of human creativity is designed and programmed, it would perhaps not be unlike Leonardo da Vinci in its scientific and artistic output. Such a device would give rise to some curious paradoxes due, in large part, to the reproducibility and communicability of electronic systems such as computers. While many fear that such a device would in its final form mark the death of the personal human imagination, the author feels that this type of device could become an important aid in solving the increasingly complex scientific and social difficulties besetting humankind and could serve as an avenue for an expanded spectrum of new art forms.", null, null, null, null, "Impervious to the intellectual insights of critical epistemology, most of us continue most of the time to imprison ourselves in the illusion that we can and do perceive reality directly \u2018as it is\u2019.

Historical approaches to this problem have employed various dualisms to separate different parts of the processes that generate form, whether in organismic development, evolution or cognition, and to locate different causes and characteristics in these parts, to one of which is usually ascribed a distinct essence, which is regarded as the generator of distinctive form. A number of these dualisms are examined, starting with that of Descartes, out of which emerges an alternative approach to the problem.", null, "In 1962, the Swedish-born author, who was 28 years old at the time, had the good fortune to meet Billy Kluver, who took him to the laser department at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey and introduced him to the magic power of laser light.

This freedom has allowed the author to produce a series of monotype works, including large-scale pieces, with rainbows mixed from spectrally pure colors to pastel tones. The imagery, combining shadowgram, photogram, found object and text, renders a non-linear narrative emphasizing the privacy of the act of perception.", null, "According to the neo-Darwinists theory of evolution, biological form, like all properties of organisms, arises through natural selection. Those forms that give an advantage persist; those that do not are eliminated. Eventually, therefore, organisms possess only useful forms, and we explain why a form exists by giving an account of how it is useful. The trouble with this argument is that it does not tell us where the forms came from in the first place. We need to know not only what was selected but also what the choice was, what it was selected from. Neo-Darwinists, however, insist that all traits of organisms arise through the selection of large numbers of variations that are small but otherwise random. Nothing can or need be said about their origin, and traits are thus created, not just preserved, by natural selection. In fact, form in biology is created in much the same way as it is in the inanimate world; therefore, it is also to be explained in much the same way. Natural selection gives biology a distinctive character but does not, as so many seem to think, set it apart from the rest of science.", null, "The author suggests that a paradigm shift must occur in art criticism to assimilate the nonlinear branching of aesthetic activities in our era. These activities include computer art and scientific visualization, and they reflect many issues addressed in postmodern dialogue such as our image-synthetic, \u201csimulacrum\u201d society. Postmodernism unexpectedly informs most disciplines, including the natural sciences, and is a cultural systemic norm that relates to our electronic information age. The Taoist concept of oneness is used as a metaphor for the interrelatedness of electronic-mediated societies, and this social connectedness explains the enfolding and complex nature of contemporary aesthetic activity. A cybernetic paradigm might provide a better model for criticism than modernism or postmodernism, since this paradigm presents a holistic view that concentrates on creativity and the organization of interrelated systems. The convergence of art with science is assumed as a logical interdisciplinary outgrowth of this electronic oneness.", null, "The authors propose that a standard local-area network (LAN) be developed for real-time control and communication among performance systems, such as music synthesizers, tape players, lighting equipment, slide projectors, laser projectors, video projectors and live performers. The existing MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard, although useful, is too limited for such applications, and most commercial LANs are not designed for the requirements of demanding, real-time control. Hence a new network standard is proposed, provisionally called ArcoNet (Artist's Computer Network).", null, null, null, null, null, "Renaissance artists constructed pictorial space using algorithms based on Euclidean geometry. Computer artists use algorithms based on the analytic geometry of Descartes to compute pictures as well as the subjects in them. An examination of the workings of these two different types of algorithm reveals that the computer offers a radical new approach to making art, which is not yet well understood. Postmodern algorithms for picturemaking are more evanescent than their Renaissance counterparts because computers process information conceptually instead of storing it physically.

Wherever van Gogh lived, he recorded both day-to-day changes in the weather and dominant characteristics of the climate with only the small degree of exaggeration typical of many artists. Van Gogh represented atmospheric visibility as lowest in Paris, where urban air pollution had already become a serious problem. Although he seldom devoted great attention to precise cloud forms, the obviously distorted cumulus and mountain wave clouds he painted in Saint-R\u00e9my reveal with a perspicacity exceptional in Western art how clouds mark the air's flow patterns.

Can pure geometry be perceived by the \u2018man in the street\u2019 as beautiful? To be more specific, can a shape that is defined by a simple equation or a simple rule of construction be perceived by people other than geometers as having aesthetic value\u2014namely, as being at least surprisingly decorative\u2014or perhaps even as being a work of art? When the geometric shape is a fractal, the answer is yes. Even when fractals are taken \u2018raw\u2019, they are attractive. They lend themselves to \u2018painting by numbers\u2019 that is surprisingly effective, even in the hands of the rank amateur. And the true artist's sensibility finds them a novel and attractive support.", "Although new technology is widely used for detailed design and image manipulation, its use in the early stages of visual invention is much less common, one reason being that the denotation systems used in paper-and-pencil sketching assist creativity in ways that are poorly understood. Leonardo da Vinci advocated the use of untidy indeterminacies for working out composition, because he believed that they stimulated visual invention. Recent research in cognitive psychology suggests a mental-imagery model that expands Leonardo's theory and provides evidence for cognitive mechanisms that clarify the function of familiar sketch attributes. Sketches may mediate mental translation between spatially depictive and structurally descriptive modes of visual representation. Evidence for a hybrid percept-image theory of ordinary paper sketching is briefly outlined. Some implications of this theory for the development of improved computer sketching systems are briefly discussed.", "The author takes two approaches in perceiving and depicting nature. When depicting a landscape containing many spatial elements, he considers himself but a small particle of the universe, a reference point: the perspective of the landscape is directed from the human being towards the infinitely big. When depicting flowers, plants or animals, the author becomes absorbed in the study of the elements and particles of the universe: the perspective is directed from the human being towards the infinitely small. In both cases, one perceives time, mass and space interacting in movement. The movement engenders cadence. Apprehending the cadence of the big and the small, one perceives the harmony and structure of the world. The author considers nature his great teacher. By observing the infinite multitude of the forms of existence, every artist can find the forms and laws of nature that are close to his or her perception.", null, "The author describes a computer-based approach intended to facilitate the design and fabrication of his abstract sculpture.

Nine ways of visualizing time, based on objective and subjective findings, were created for the course. Four objective ways are presented in exercise form in this article. They are preceded by two subjective warm-up exercises and followed by three subjective/objective exercises in the visualization of verbs. The warm-up exercises stimulated the students' perception of time and motion, while the exercises in visualizing verbs allowed them to apply their newly acquired subjective/objective insights and knowledge to create a visual dictionary of verbs. In the process, any and all tools were used for manual, mechanical, electronic, light-generated or biological exploration of the shape of time.", null, "The author demonstrates how studies from the behavioral sciences have been applied in design from the nineteenth century up to present-day design theory and practice.

Six drawings consisting of three panels each were created and analyzed by the artist during the course of the study. The controlling factor was the rule-set, or syntax, by which each drawing was systematically developed. Areas of interpretation include the possibility of inherent knowledge, or animism, in a work of art; information-richness as a function of discrete high/low space usage decisions; expansion and/or contraction of worldview concepts through landscape structural understanding; and cross-modality links between space use and life processes.

Under certain circumstances there is not only a hidden but an obvious relationship between anamorphoses and holograms. Due to the unique storage system of holograms, the author feels that, in studying the nature of holograms, one should take anamorphoses into consideration. While a photograph records a subject point to point, in a hologram the information is spread across the film. An anamorphosis can be represented in a drawing construed on a two-dimensional surface or, as explained in this article, in a hologram of a three-dimensional subject.

Figures of apotropaic function and value seem to contradict this holistic paradigm, since single traits are found to reappear under different cultural and historical conditions with exceptional conformity and \u2018archaic\u2019 perseverance. Comparative and cross-cultural studies have yielded some evidence for the interpretation of similar expressions\u2014such as \u2018making faces\u2019, showing the tongue, presenting the buttocks or genitals, etc.\u2014as ritualized forms of a common pattern in human communication.", "Sensing the close relationship between sculpture and holography, the artist fused these media, adding electroacoustic music and fiber optics to enhance the overall impact. He thus created what he refers to as \u2018holosculpture\u2019. While working to integrate sculpture and holography, he found that the brightness of the holograms did not allow the sculpture to be viewed properly. The solution was to show the sculptures and holograms alternately, which he achieved by using electronically operated lighting systems.

The period is internally organized on two levels: by the pulse and by the minimal operational values. Rhythm consists in the imposition of cyclic figures\u2014with or without variations\u2014on an underlying period. Rhythmic figures can be defined by a set of five features: mark, durations, morphology, metricity and structure. The dominant rhythmic feature in Central Africa is a contrametric relationship to the pulse, which creates an antagonism between the rhythmical events and their temporal framework. Polyrhythmic music results from the interaction of two or more superposed rhythmic figures, which may vary in dimensions but have periods standing in simple ratios, and its dominant feature is the interweaving of accents, tone colors and/or attacks of the simultaneously performed figures. This gives rise to a conflict between rhythm and rhythm, which is coupled with the antagonism between rhythm and meter characterizing each individual figure.

The author discusses the most significant of these instruments which, in many cases, were developed by experimenters working in isolation.", "Three exercises in manual, mechanical and electronic imaging by magnetics are presented. The exercises show how, with nothing more than some magnetic copier toner, a few magnets and some paper, one can create powerful images simply and manually.

With the development of television and the microcomputer, print-based text no longer can monopolize our symbolic environment.

According to Lissitzky, non-objectivity in art was analogous to the modern concept of number, and the structure of a work of art corresponded to mathematical concepts such as functions and systems. These theories demonstrate Lissitzky's divergence from both Suprematism and Russian Constructivism. Furthermore, the analogies elucidate the artist's insistence on order, his notion of the art-game and the relationship between intuition and intellect in the creative act. An analysis of pictorial space by analogy with real and imaginary numbers and a comparison of art with set theory help clarify the system of the Proun paintings and the theoretical base of Lissitzky's exhibition spaces. They also expand our understanding of Lissitzky's relationship to Malevich's Suprematism.

In both the painter's studio and the physicist's laboratory, this process appears to be the progressive recognition of a \u2018sense\u2019 in an ensemble of perceived signs, be they brushstrokes or numbers. Both artists and scientists refine this ordering process in their work, by repeatedly comparing the evolving form with spontaneous or intentionally generated sensorial data, until a meaning is felt.

Referring to a conversation with the late physicist Werner Heisenberg, who was among the first to propose the concept of a universal atomic length in respect to quantum physics, she discusses various processes in experimental physics in which this unit can be seen as playing an important role. A diagram illustrates the process of abstraction that led to her visual metaphor.

The author introduces the concept of proceduralism as a label to represent a special class of art, one that constructs images using abstract qualitative and quantitative parameters, rather than simulates classical drawing and painting. This approach to making art differs radically from drawing and painting approaches because the picture-making process is detached from the picture. The net result is that an entirely new area of creativity has been unveiled for the artist. As such, proceduralism is a logical successor to conceptual/process art; it is a major art movement and a new medium.", "The author examines the history of photocopiers, their use by artists and the movements that have sprouted up in countries where copier-generated art has been influential.

This is a familiar theme in painting for the art market, but perhaps it has been even more systematically explored in images made in scientific work. The author contrasts exact recording of three-dimensional shape in objects, seen in many representational, perspective pictures for science, with planar abstract patterns, which emerged from experiments on such phenomena as light, magnetism and electricity. The contrast between these two types of scientific imagery, representational and abstract, conceals connections between them, some of which the author discusses.", null, "The importance and value of holography as an art medium can be poorly substantiated by a superficial comparison with diversified aesthetic expressions from the past; this often has been done. However, any truly useful analysis of the unique aesthetic message of holography first has to deal with the medium itself and the investigation of its inherent autonomous structure. Holography realty should be understood as a specific aesthetic expression of our times that opens us to a new perception of our philosophy of life. The author demonstrates some parameters of the autonomous structure of holography. The aesthetic message of the medium discussed in that way is distinguished by an immediate paradox: the holographic image appears to be a normal picture, but simultaneously the illusion of the image that normally would be expected is completely destroyed. Consequently, the traditional difference between image and reality in general is overcome and cancelled. Thus holography makes a radical break with geometric, perspective optics. At the same time, the predominant paradigm of objectivity as an illusion of reality is revealed.", "In separate conversations, four artists discuss their monumental-scale works involving natural phenomena.

As an artist, he attempts to merge a traditional way of representing artistic content with an unusual approach to dealing with artistic form. The computer program itself becomes the artwork, and in the work described, the artist depicts a complex religious theme that reflects his continuing exploration of the relationship between art, the unconscious mind and personal mythology.

She also discusses her method of using photocopying equipment to blow up photographs of particular sites to create backgrounds for her environmental drawings.", "As the computer becomes more greatly accepted in the arts, much of what we now call \u2018computer art\u2019 will be absorbed by existing media. At the same time, computer art will develop from a minor, derivative medium to one with its own distinctive (and as yet mostly unimagined) characteristics. New opportunities will abound for the artist to develop the possibilities that the computer presents. Programming is the most effective way to explore and develop these possibilities. It should be taught to artists in a way in a way tailored to their visual orientation, perhaps using one of the new versions of computer languages that make visual programming less frustrating for the novice. Artists should also make a contribution to software development in general.", null, null, "The author expresses his opinion that new imagemaking technology is providing an interdisciplinary language and creating a requirement for generalists rather than specialists. This new technology is also initiating a paradigm shift in those disciplines that make use of it. Lack of acknowledgment of such effects, particularly in the area of higher education, could lead to significant problems that, in the longer term, could affect manufacturing industry and national economic performance. One solution is to involve practitioners of non-applied disciplines (such as fine arts and pure science and mathematics) that have already adapted to a similar paradigm change and whose perception of the new tools and techniques is likely to be less parochial and more flexible.", null, null, null, "An extensive collection of writings on scientific, mathematical and aesthetic aspects of symmetry is used to discuss the most appropriate range of the concept of symmetry.

A regular tiling, such as the tiling of squares or of equilateral triangles, is made up of regular shapes fitting together in a regular way. It is sometimes possible to combine a number of regular tilings to make a regular compound tiling: imagine the tilings drawn on transparent sheets and laid on top of each other. There is a close connection between regular compound tilings and tilings in which the tiles are coloured to form an orderly, regular pattern. But regularly coloured tilings, usually called perfect colourings, are not always associated with regular compounds in the normal sense. The author's discussion of the surroundings of the hyperbolic plane encourages the reader to contemplate tilings made up of tiles that are not regular, or made up of tiles that are regular but infinite and much more complex than the regular polygons of elementary geometry.", null, "The invention of Polaroid in 1938 opened up new horizons for artists, giving them the opportunity of applying the fourth dimension of time to their work. The author traces the development of his work with Polaroid from his early experiments, using a handmade cardboard slide viewer with two Polaroid discs inserted, to his current Kinetichrome projections, which utilize computerized control to intensify color and movement as desired.

She defines context as the relationship of art to its place, to its public and to a time. This philosophy has led her to consider the various hypotheses that inform her work, some of which include the primacy of site, accessibility of art to the public and art's position in the social and economic system of today.", "The authors describe three experiments that examine the relationship between the amount of information in artworks and aesthetic response. Following Berlyne's views, an inverted U function should be obtained, i.e. a moderate amount of information would be most pleasing to the viewer. Informational density defined as amount of information was controlled through computer digitized manipulation of black-and-white art reproductions. Subjects included university students both with and without specific art training. Results tended to support a straight-line function of arousal (visual potency) ratings as associated with increasing informational density for untrained subjects, while an inverted U-shaped arousal curve in Berlyne's terms resulted for trained subjects. Continued application of information manipulation of art provides a useful technique for controlling and varying the visual structure of art in the study of aesthetic responses.", "The author has developed an optical image-processing system for photography, cinema and video.

Current examples of artistic works are discussed within a philosophical context.", null, "Human activity, art oriented or not, implies an aesthetic component. Intelligence participates in this activity by helping to define goals in knowledged-based selection from among many options, while the aesthetic component structures outcomes, endows them with expressive power, and facilitates communication. Artifacts qualifying as works of art embody human intelligence and sensibility, as well as the experience of aesthetically applied technology. Imitation of past artistic paradigms, even when new technologies (computer-based or not) are used, precludes the discovery of new sources of beauty and thus precludes originality. The expansion and redefinition of the artistic universe that new science and technology make possible have already resulted in a broader notion of art and in new forms of artistic activity. Consequently, our concept of beauty is emancipated and expanded to include the beauty of scientific theories, some requiring visual means of expression that only new technology makes available.", null, "The author conducts a simple thought experiment investigating the existence and scope of \u2018computational art': the utilization of the computer in the visual arts and music. In the experiment he sets the task of constructing an artifact that is capable of producing works of art. Since it appears that the artifact needs at least the capability of imagination, he queries the nature of images and imagery and argues that imagination is strongly intentional. Next he introduces the concept of notational systems, since they seem to govern the artistic activity of (not exclusively) machines. Confronted with the question of whether we are able to develop a computational analogue for taste, he finds that notational systems prove to be necessary for mediating the method of production of an artwork and the appraisal of its artistic value. Furthermore, the author shows that there are certain epistemological limits to the creativity of an imaginative device. Although the outcome of this hypothetical construction task clearly denies the possibility of an autonomously creative artifact, there seems to be no reason to worry about the opportunities for computational art: the computer appears to be a unique tool in exploring the possibilities of artistic production, guided by artists.", null, "Skinner attributes creativity to \u2018behavioral mutations\u2019, unusual acts emitted accidentally but selected by the environment for reinforcement. The author suggests that Skinner's account can adequately encompass many creative phenomena, notably some recent, influential artistic approaches and the sex differences in productivity. However, the account also shows serious weaknesses. In particular, it implies that all individuals, including subhumans, are equally capable of creative behavior, and that an individual's creative acts, and his or her evaluation of them, must reflect the environment's standards. Moreover, Skinner has ignored important complications of creativity's definition and practice.", "Sculptor Henry Moore and his work are eulogized in this memorial speech delivered to UNESCO House, Paris, October 1986.", "The philosopher Leibniz proposed a paradox to Newton's friend Clarke: suppose that the universe existed twice in perfect symmetry; then it nevertheless would exist only once. Leibniz's \u2018principle of the identity of the indiscernible\u2019 was first taken seriously by Weyl, the theoretician of symmetry. Weyl saw that a test may be possible if perfectly equal particles exist. The symmetry then exists in position space, a space more abstract than real space. However, since the former is only a way of talking about the latter, the absurd collapse would still make itself felt in reality. A mobile made of two equal balls captures it all, generating stunning illusions of switching identities. They become reality if the two balls are perfectly equal. Symmetry is stronger than classical logic.", "The author examines the question of how an artist's ideas are expressed in a work of art. His \u2018logical landscapes\u2019 are pictures in which abstract principles determine the organization of the composition.

In 1976, it produced the largest holograms being made at that time; as a result, the laboratory became well known around the world, and many requests from artists interested in this new means of expression were received. In 1978, the laboratory developed a new technique allowing the recording of animated portraits by a pulsed laser. The application dealt with repetitive sequences of animated holography.

Reviewing art since World War I, the author finds not only important works proliferating in this form recently but also a definite history to be traced. The form first appears in the work of Marcel Duchamp, who was the first major artist to place the game of chess in an artistic context. \u00d6yvind Fahlstr\u00f6m made moveable paintings and some of the first original game-as-art works. Later, a large number of artists from diverse artistic backgrounds explored the game-as-art form. Some of these artists made innovations in traditional games, others used the form for a specific impact and still others created works to encourage social interaction. What is lacking is a set of criteria for judging the aesthetic qualities of a game-as-art work. The game-as-art form holds an aesthetic challenge to today's artists and promises to be an important art form of the future.", "How is it possible that, during the performance of music, tempo can be controlled in such a way that, even for a long-lasting piece, there are only minute differences of tempo between the beginning and the end? From the biological and psychological viewpoint this question is rather difficult to answer. A new theory is proposed that tries to link tempo control in music to the neuronal mechanisms of the brain that underlie human time perception and the timing of intentional acts. Elementary temporal experiences\u2014 i.e. simultaneity, asynchrony, succession, the subjective present and duration\u2014are structured within a hierarchical model. One aspect of this model is that it allows one to talk about a \u2018brain-clock\u2019 that underlies, it is suggested, tempo control in music.", "The author argues that Artificial Intelligence concepts will not lead to the development of a truly creative machine if limited merely to simulating the peripheral processes of the artist.

This paper proposes, through use of computers and digital raster graphics, a means of measuring the color balance of an image through proportions of red, green and blue intensities. With this method of measurement it is possible to apply several theories of color harmony and balance to computer-based abstract imagery. Through the computer we get specific control of the process. If, through this technique, a quantifiable means of creating concordant color relationships is possible, then it makes color available to the composer as material for the coherent structuring of time. As in tonal music, movement in time can be established by movement in and out of balanced, consonant areas. An area of balanced color relationships could be thought of as a tonic space, functioning like the tonic pitch or key in tonal music.", null, null, null, "The author writes of her collaborative work with Alan Powell in electronic image making and processing. She discusses some of the issues raised by using new technologies in the development of experimental media work and gives a brief history of how she and Powell deal with the new tools, in terms both of gaining access to them and of developing an aesthetic based on their use. She illustrates her points by describing a number of their video works and, in a concluding statement, summarizes their guiding philosophy.", "The kinship that holograms have with hallucination and mirage leads the author to a theoretical reflection on the imaginary Double as related to the image of the body. This correspondence to the archetype of human thought is one of the main formal specificities of pulsed holography, besides of course the illusion of the third dimension. The author uses this correspondence as a means of discussing the contemporary tendency of art and culture to reduplicate themselves, thereby almost creating their own imaginary Doubles.", null, "The bubbled plastic print is a new form of printmaking that has appeared in China in recent years. The author and inventor of this art form introduces its artistic characteristics as well as the materials and tools involved in its making. The techniques discussed can be useful to artists engaged in the field of printmaking.", null, null, "Computers with graphics can be used to produce visual representations of complicated physical and mathematical structures and phenomena. This paper presents an overview of spiral geometry in mathematics, nature, physics, civilization and art, with an emphasis on novel spiral forms created by the author. \u2018Recipes\u2019 for both traditional and nontraditional spirals are given. The computer-generated patterns are of interest artistically and mathematically, and they reveal a visually striking and intricate class of spirals whose generating algorithms range from electronic circuit equations to random segment methods.", "The author introduces her thesis that, although abstract painting is considered self-referential, it is in fact a visual language that reflects reality. In describing the relation between reality and the artist, she refers primarily to her own study and experience. After explaining how painting becomes a language that reflects reality, she comments on the ideas contained in some of her own paintings.", "The author discusses her development of manipulative hologram displays and hologram puzzles, as well as her educational theories and use of movement experience and demonstrations to convey holographic concepts. Adults' and children's reactions to holograms and future implications of holography in education are also addressed.", null, null, null, null, null, "The author's original 1959 essay examines the effects of environment on the learning process. The important role of teachers in encouraging self-motivation in students is stressed, as is the need for an integrated curriculum which avoids duplication of material from one course to another. A society that provides its children optimum learning conditions from an early age will reap significant benefits as the talents of its members will be most fully developed. In a 1986 postscript the author reevaluates his original points in light of experience gained in the intervening years.", "This essay cites the critical function of binocular parallax in stereography and holography. The control and manipulation of this attribute are central to the artistic potential of these unique pictorial technologies. The relationship between hypostereoscopy, hyperstereoscopy and the viewer's perception of space is outlined, and the author explores a few research directions, including a possible approach to quantifying and measuring automatically the aggregate stereo cue of any stereogram or hologram.", null, "The life of Borodin, who was better known as a composer than as a chemist, is briefly outlined, along with a consideration of his musical and chemical activities. His creations, both musical and scientific, are relatively few, but their quality is high, especially in music. His limited output was due to his lack of adequate time rather than to any innate conflict between art and science.", null, null, null, "The author discusses the role of holography as a fine-arts medium, with particular reference to his work in mixed-media, holography, photography and sculpture.", null, null, null, null, null, "The author takes a critical look at holographic art, posing the question, What are some significant holograms produced thus far?", null, "To obtain uniformity of a preferred painting surface or for superior durability, some painters prefer to prepare their own canvases rather than to use commercially prepared canvas. The author describes an ancient method of canvas preparation that he has used with excellent results. Paintings prepared in this manner 300 years ago have been found to have exceptional durability.", "The author addresses a number of issues related to the potential of computer graphics and animation systems to enhance or reenforce the process of artistic creativity and evolution. Various constraints imposed by computer graphics systems are explored and the major psychological characteristics of creative thinking are described. Issues are raised regarding the impact on these characteristics by the properties and process inherent in computer graphics and animation systems and their potential as agents for personal evolution in the arts.", "The author discusses his development and use of a type of musical instrument he calls electroacoustic percussion boards (EPBs). These are essentially sheets of plywood cut into particular shapes, with various hardware devices attached. These devices, which are played in a number of ways, such as by striking, scraping and plucking, give a sculptural appearance to the instruments. Specific instruments are described and some playing techniques discussed. Contact microphones have proved effective with these instruments, as has digital processing as a compositional resource. The aesthetic orientation of the design of EPBs as well as their value as an education tool is explained.", null, "Beginning with a new definition of musical instruments, Fran\u00e7ois Baschet analyzes various ways of making sounds without the help of electronics. He then examines different fields in which sound-producing sculptures and instruments can be used. Bernard Baschet focuses on the applicability of sound sculpture to music education. Fran\u00e7ois Baschet then proposes a plan for the next 20 years.", "The author examines the parallel history of soap bubbles and soap films in art and science. Noting that mathematicians in particular have been intrigued by their complex geometry, he traces the research in this field from the first experiments by Joseph Plateau in the late nineteenth century to recent work using computer graphics in the theory of minimal surfaces. He identifies the beginnings of what could be called \u2018Math Art\u2019.", null, null, null, "Lead has been used for centuries as an art paint ingredient. And for centuries it has been associated with serious health effects. Every phase of painting with lead carries some hazard: from using raw pigments in making the paints to restoring old paintings. For this reason, it is both wise and ethical to replace lead with safer substances whenever possible. However, in some instances, serious aesthetic requirements may be met best by using lead materials. In these cases, careful preparations should be made to use lead safely. These include providing appropriate ventilation, protective equipment and facilities for good hygiene and cleaning. When used in this thoughtful, professional manner, lead can be used without harm.", "The author discusses the American street mural movement in general as background to a critical evaluation of four murals. The major portion of the article is a critique of these four street murals, which, it is argued, are radical antitechnological statements in response to a high-technology world. These works make statements on the role of high technology in food production, the power of large corporations, and the possibility of nuclear war.", "Images of artworks can be stored in media that preserve different characteristics of the original. Differences exist in the extent to which we can preserve color, three-dimensionality, surface texture, fine structure, tonal gradations, temporal variations and other characteristics that lend uniqueness to individual artworks. Usually, we are willing to sacrifice some of these characteristics in exchange for the permanence and recoverability offered by storage media. Thus, a color slide (diapositive), which is a common medium for storing images of artworks, compromises all of the above properties to different extents but is nevertheless considered useful for the archival properties it offers for images of artworks. Digital storage media used in conjunction with computers offer new opportunities and demand new compromises in storing art images. An unusual challenge is offered by the possibility of providing intelligence to a computer. The authors make clear the sense in which we may ascribe intelligence to the computer and how this may be used to \u2018perceive\u2019 the image of an artwork. The computer then uses its knowledge of the artwork with respect to a large class of such works not only for archival storage but also to achieve economy in the use of the storage medium. The authors illustrate the achievement of storage economy as much as tens of thousands of times greater than storage without intelligence. The intelligence is provided to the computer as syntactic descriptions of classes of artworks. The syntactic descriptions incorporate insight from the art historian, critic or artist who uses innovative tools like shape grammars to provide the computer with a small part of the intelligence that the educated human viewer brings to the perception of the artwork.", null, null, null, "If the nonverbal and emotionally evocative aesthetic of music is to be extended to visual art, we must examine the psychology of sight and the intuitive uses of this psychology by visual artists. The structure of the eye, the nerve connections between the eye and the brain, and the visual cortex can give us clues as to how human perception is uniquely sensitive. These sensitivities, amplified through the self-expression of artists, can induce emotional responses that are more related to the form of the expression than to the content of the imagery. Works by the author and by other artists who influenced him are used to illustrate these points.", "The author explains that computer art is still in its initial stages of development, for it has been in existence but a short time and the underlying technology is not yet fully mature. He anticipates that high-resolution screens will lead to better images and that improved computer performance will permit real-time animation of photorealistic images. Three-dimensional representation will stimulate visual artists to work and think in new ways, for their concern will no longer be the problem of perspective, which will be handled by the computer, but rather the spatial design of objects and sceneries that can be expanded at will beyond the image on the screen. In its final stage of development, computer art might also be able to include elements of literature and to develop a plot in which the user, through interaction, can play a part.", null, null, null, null, null, "Images of evolution can mirror the developmental nature of making art while revealing some of the implications of progress. The author describes how her paintings and drawings build on the evolutionary themes of biological, technological and social transformations. She places images associated with specific scientists and architects in contexts that emphasize these transformations. Her work explores an organic basis of technological and architectural shapes. The resulting forms, which often appear futuristic, contrast with her fresco-like technique of fifteenth-century panel painting. Her experiences as a painter have encouraged her to view technology's forms as contemporary icons that are rooted in nature.", null, "The author describes her painterly approach to the enameling and firing of panels and hand-formed hammered steel relief shapes. She discusses her introduction to and study of the enameling process and explains the various procedures involved. She concludes with a personal view of her enamel pieces and examines how they are influenced by her methods of painting on canvas.", "In this article, the author concentrates on sculpture and drawings made during the last nine years, linking them with earlier work. Her focus has been the illusion of matter and its equivalence with energy. A desire to resolve the problems of duality has led her to an understanding of cyclic matriarchal societies of the past in which change and flow were accepted and duality was unknown. She believes she still holds fragments of a matriarchal past in her unconscious and juxtaposes its hidden imagery with contemporary materials and technology.", null, "The author presents a model of projective perspective named Modular Network and analyzes how it differs from vectorial methods, primarily in regard to its geometric conception based on tri\u2013dimensional models. He discusses the principles of modular scale as well as the characteristics of the plane onto which the image is projected in perspective and the importance of taking the focal distance into account so as to control the projection according to a determined aperture of the visual field. The usage of the author's modular scale, whose design is based on the determination of the scale of depth, is shown in a graphical perspective.", null, "The aesthetics of viruses is worthy of investigation even if these organisms represent a potential hazard for the health and life of living beings. The extracellular virus (virion) is a \u2018monumental\u2019 product of nature in that it contains a vast amount of information in its clear, concise and puritanic structure. In this paper, structures produced by evolutionary processes are compared and contrasted with those designed by humans. It is noted that discoveries in geometry and architecture have had beneficial influence on research on viruses, and vice versa.", "The author addresses relations between literature and United States society from 1926 through 1986. This relationship is first addressed via a description of the roaring 1920s in terms of the sale of a pickle. Then the author discusses his research and creation of formant music involving melodious, dissonant, rise/fall resonances in the upper oral regions of the vocal tract. This is \u2018whisper music\u2019 made by differing the shapes of the oral cavity through postures of the tongue, lips and jaws. Third, an alphabetic notation for performance called \u2018prosodynic print\u2019 is introduced. Here, distorted but readable letters act as cues to instruct readers to speak levels of intensity, pitch and duration of vowels, i.e. modulation of voiced speech. Relations of voiced speech through the larynx and pharynx of the lower vocal tract with oral resonances in the upper vocal tract are discussed.", null, null, "Visible language, the visual medium of language expression, is becoming more diagrammatic, dynamic, and multi-dimensional. After reviewing the history of visible languages, the author examines the incorporation of these new tendencies in his own works of concrete poetry, computer graphics, and conceptual art.", null, "The author discusses the way in which the reward-systems for the professions of art and architecture influence practitioners' perceptions of their respective roles. Status is considered to be an important factor in this relationship. Following the ideas of Thorstein Veblen on the so-called \u2018trickle effect\u2019, the role of status in determining the perceptions of consumers of art and architecture is considered. Consumers are little interested in the issues, invariably formal and abstract, that concern professionals. Artists and architects are urged to address themselves to these realities and engage in a genuine attempt to create for the marketplace if they wish to influence the character of the environment.", null, "The authors present a teaching method that brings together art, mathematics and nature in one course. They discuss the philosophy behind and reasons for such an approach and explain their teaching objectives and the methodology they employ for attaining them.", "The author describes his sound sculptures which explore how various instances of sound possess musical form. He explains the sculptural qualities of sound and the aesthetic act of arranging sound into art. Detailed descriptions of three recent works illustrate how relocating sounds from one environment to another redefines them, giving them new acoustic meanings.", "The new materials of twentieth\u2013century technology provided both the means and the inspiration for the three\u2013dimensional works of the Constructivists. Plastic, which was particularly versatile, was employed frequently by Naum Gabo and his brother Antoine Pevsner to realise the innovative sculptural forms advocated in their \u201cRealistic Manifesto\u201d of 1920. In Gabo's more organic works and linear compositions of the 1930s and 1940s, it can even be postulated that the development of acrylic plastics and filaments made such works possible. However, early plastics were extremely unstable and have discoloured, warped or even decomposed over time. The author explores the effect of deterioration on various works to demonstrate the urgent need for research on early plastics to aid the conservation of these sculptures.", "Contemporary music is often thought of in terms of musical objects where tonic notes, appropriately clustered, give a mass corresponding to height and tessitura criteria. A mathematical characterization of a musical phrase permits various visualization techniques of the figure. In accord with philosophical concepts, the pattern is perfectly represented by an envelope which is a tangent surface at a set of notes in a polyphonic score. Two image models are discussed in this paper. The first is based on the B-spline surfaces smoothing a discrete musical event set in the space: height-duration-timbre. The second performs the Discrete Fourier Transform signature of the digital musical signal.", "The author describes several large-scale installation sculptures completed between 1980 and 1985. All of these sculptures involve natural and cultural concerns and reflect the author's interest in the effects of nature and culture on the total environment. The installations use large ceramic vessels to represent real and imagined cultures; vast shaped platforms painted intense colors represent the ground, the support system of the sculpture. Elements of cultural, political and artistic consciousness are symbolically layered within each work.", null, "The author describes the landscape sculpture through which he hopes to initiate a dialogue with the earth. The project is located in the Carrizo Plain along the San Andreas Fault in California. Symbols inscribed along the axial line of the fault and a sound system that plays a symphonic composition and simultaneously records the earth's sounds will serve as the media for communication between artist and the earth during the next, inevitable earthquake at this site.", "The future of publishing is discussed in light of the \u2018third industrial revolution\u2019, now in progress, which is based upon information and the application of computers and electronics to information processing. The application of correct technologies will result in increased efficiency in both information dissemination by publishers and information retrieval by the end users.", null, "The author first presents the theoretical basis of his work and some thoughts on the use of computers in the arts. He then describes four interactive computer-based installations that he has completed over the past several years. While all the works contained visual components, major portions of these constructed environments were the sounds generated by the perceivers. The ways the sounds organized the spaces and the effects of these pieces on the perceivers are also discussed.", "The artist traces the influences of Generative Systems technology and philosophy on her work in photography. Coping with the initial limitations of scale and focus inherent in electrostatic copy systems has led the author to revise her relationship with the camera and the external world.", "Fluorescent and phosphorescent colours, long considered to be the materials of the specialist, require careful handling to be used efficiently. The author discusses European products available to the American artist, gives a brief explanation of the physical processes involved in luminescence and suggests how artists may use luminescence to best effect in their work. In conclusion the author outlines current developmental work and possible future trends.", null, "This presentation covers some of the historical and aesthetic questions raised by the fine arts community regarding the use of computers by artists. Before addressing issues related specifically to the computer, the author gives a preamble that provides a context and creates a texture for the comments relating to the computer and its role in the visual arts. Comments are offered on the role of technology, science, mathematics, the humanities and aesthetics in the visual arts.", "The author describes how she combines photography and weaving to create tapestry in the form of a triptych. The triptych allows her to explore images from different points of view. After selecting a set of photographs\u2014usually fragments of nature\u2014she seeks the most appropriate way to \u2018translate\u2019 the imagery into the language of tapestry. By introducing a second warp, she is able to transpose the sense of depth in the photographs to the tapestry.", "Abbott H. Thayer (1849\u20131921), a prominent U.S. painter, was one of the first to describe in detail the function of protective coloration in nature. In military history, he frequently is credited with the first military applications of countershading and disruptive patterning, so that he was known among friends as \u2018the father of camouflage\u2019. This essay is a brief review of Thayer's lifelong involvement in the study of both natural and military camouflage.", "Computer-generated line drawings are most commonly produced by pen plotters, and quality depends primarily on the equipment used. The main controlling parameters are accuracy and precision, but the plotter mechanism may impose a stepped or ragged structure on lines. Thus while they may remain within tolerance, their visual quality is affected. Pens for plotters must be chosen for reliable operation under conditions of mechanical handling, usually without continuous supervision. Users can influence the quality of their drawings by appropriate choice of drawing procedure, particularly by ensuring that the result depends on the precision rather than the accuracy of the plotter.", null, "The author describes the development of his works through three phases: deconstruction of technological images; mixing and dissemination of fragments; and fractal synthesis. Seen from close up, the works appear to be unfinished figurative images. Viewed from an intermediate distance the assembled fragments constitute a turbulent space, while from afar they constitute a global abstract image. Although stimulated by scientific theory, the artist favors chaos, inspiration and empiricism in practice.", "Six musicians give brief artists' statements on the theme \u201cThe Future of Music\u201d.", "Holographic artists working with continuous-wave lasers are restricted mainly to rigid, still subject matter. The pulsed laser \u2018freezes\u2019 moving subjects for the duration of the holographic exposure and increases the artist's scope to include live subjects. This article gives a historical background to pulsed holography, a short description of the pulsed laser, a comparison between continuous-wave and pulsed holographic practice and a discussion of individual holographic artworks made with a pulsed laser.", null, "This essay examines various charges of illusionism that have been leveled at traditional forms of representation by proponents of Modernism and Postmodernism. The author finds these charges philosophically groundless and attempts to offer a diagnosis of the motivation and real significance behind these charges.", "Artists are using technological advances in their artmaking processes and are concerned about the difficulty of getting their work exhibited. The author discusses the aesthetics of exhibition and the nature of computer-aided art as seen in recent important exhibitions, as well as the problems associated with mounting these exhibitions. A brief history of computer-aided art exhibitions is presented, including the earliest exhibitions, the developments of the 1970s and recent major museum exhibitions. The author compares concepts and traditions in exhibition design to those that will be needed in the future, and finally discusses why certain art forms are exhibited.", null, "The author brings together art, science and music in his sound-producing sculpture. In this article he discusses his creative approach and his concerns regarding how technology is applied to art. He describes three of his major works, explaining their basis as aesthetic explorations and giving technical details about their configurations and operations.", "Since there is no cure for progress, we may assume that machines will play an increasingly significant role in every area of our lives. Artists have celebrated machines since they came into existence, first by depicting them and more recently by using them as tools and assistants. What will happen when machines make their own art? Will we recognise it and will we accept it?", "The author's approach to painting is influenced by Chinese landscape painting and its philosophical principles as well as by recent developments in science and mathematics. In examining the notion of \u2018pattern'\u2014particularly its special qualities in nature\u2014he distinguishes two broad areas of pattern: convergent (formal, predictable) and divergent (natural, unpredictable). Turning to his own work, he shows how certain images grew out of the interaction between his intuitive insights and a reasoned attempt to embrace \u2018wayward nature\u2019.", null, null, "This paper is a summary of the life and major achievements of Adelbert Ames, Jr., an American ophthalmologist and perceptual psychologist, who had initially wanted to be a visual artist. He is most widely remembered today as the inventor of the Ames Demonstrations in Perception, the most famous of which consists of a distorted room in which people seem to shrink as they walk from one corner to another. This essay discusses the relationship of the Ames Demonstrations to anamorphic visual art, and it documents various comments by perceptual psychologists and artists who were directly acquainted with Ames.", null, "After the Black Death in 1348, land values collapsed; the celibate monk became an object of ridicule while the \u2018productive and reproductive\u2019 third estate rose to power. The Catholic Church attempted to re-establish its authority at the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563) by rallying behind the theology of Saint Thomas Aquinas, but Humanist scientists and artists like Copernicus, Galileo, Raphael and Titian undermined the authority of Saint Thomas by creating a new vision of a united heaven and earth\u2014a vision that still inspires Western civilization.", "The author describes how he developed esthetic rules using mathematic structures and explains his interest in cybernetic art. Impressed by Celtic linear art, he began researching prehistoric symbols. While. investigating early allegorical ornaments, he found a correlation between the formerly intuitive finding of a form and the research of the mathematics of sensations. Although his hard-edged linear artwork led him into computer graphics, he now uses big brushes and either oil on canvas or gouache on paper.", null, "A translation is given of Truchet's 1704 paper showing that an infinity of patterns can be generated by the assembly of a single half-colored tile in various orientations. It embodies an early representation of the principles of combinatorial theory and of crystallographic symmetry including color symmetry. Simple rules of the topology of separation and junction are used to extend Truchet's concept of directional choice and, by relaxing symmetry rules, to generate diagrams illustrating field/ground relations, the hierarchy of structural freedom and the origin and nature of structural order and disorder in general.", "The author describes her encounter with the literary legacy of Bruno Schulz: how she came across Schulz's work, experienced his words, gave them expression in her art\u2014etched into 300 plates of zinc. Emphasis is placed on the consequences this encounter has had on her life and her art.", null, "The artist uses telecommunication networks linked to electronic hardware to portray a vision of suburban America and its place in a global culture. Here he details a sampling of his performance art and explains his use of technology to recreate electronically the environments of selected American institutions.", null, null, null, null, "The author describes his 25-year involvement with the constructed relief, an art form machined out of acrylic sheet and spray-painted with enamels. He places the constructed relief in its historical framework and discusses some of the practical and theoretical problems associated with developing his own works as metaphors of nature.", "Mathematics and geometry can function as integral elements in the process of organizing visual data. The author provides a brief historical perspective on artists' use of mathematics and geometry, referring specifically to the Golden Section and Dynamic Symmetry generic sets of proportioning devices. The author illustrates his use of mathematics and geometry in four of his paintings, with explanations of working methods and a rationale for this approach to visual art composition.", "The author discusses recent developments in Chinese painting, focusing on the period since Liberation. He examines the types of influences Western art and the Chinese classical tradition have had on the views, styles and techniques of contemporary Chinese artists. Particular attention is paid to landscape, bird-and-flower and figure painting.", "The author muses on the emergence of electronic art, especially computer animation, as seen from a technical perspective. The ability to make realistic imagery with computers is only a recent development, and, because of its newness, both access to and capabilities of electronic imaging are still limited. But comparison with earlier technical innovations gives some insight into how creative designers will likely react to this promising technology.", null, null, "The author links developments in modern physics with the perception of movement in sculpture. Particularly by tracing implications of Einstein's paper on the Theory of Special Relativity, the sculptor shows changes in a variety of twentieth-century art forms and in his own recent work. His current roadway installations, composed of elements arranged in a series and covered with reflective sheeting, make use of the dimension of time. Such installations depend on movement by viewers and changes in light in order to be perceived. He concludes with observations on the sources of change in art and on some unusual sources of change in his own career.", null, "The author reviews the linguistic foundations of physics, emphasizing the usage of nouns in Indo-European languages and the role of metaphor in describing natural phenomena. The relationships of language, logic and scientific explanation are then discussed, particularly the limitations inherent in Western logic for modern physics. After exploring the metaphoric nature of terminology in physics, both classical and contemporary, she describes non-verbal metaphors in representations of physical behavior. The final sections illustrate reciprocal contributions from physics vocabulary to contemporary American English and the deployment of physics ideas and language in English prose and poetry.", "The authors introduce the glass harmonica by placing it in its historical context. They then explain how, after more than a century of obscurity, the glass harmonica has been re-created, using updated methods and materials. Specific features of the instrument are examined, including its adaptability to a wide range of compositional works.", "For the past decade James Malenda has explored the visual and physical aspects of weight and balance in three-dimensional and multiposition forms. His materials have included nonferrous metals, vitreous enamels and laminated wood. His current work explores the dynamics of three-dimensional negative space as defined by the contrast of surface, color and contour in fabricated aluminum and enameled forms. In tracing the development of these concepts, he addresses his method of working and its effect on the materials and takes into account the aesthetic sculptural considerations.", "The author expresses his ideas about art, reports on his work as artist and researcher, and gives guidance for experimenting with artworks involving sunrays.", "The author defines \u2018layering\u2019 as the use of layered techniques to express a holistic worldview. She observes that some artists, working in all media, have developed a creative process in which each layer of material added or removed has formal integrity and metaphorical significance in reference to concepts from science, metaphysics, philosophy and mythology that suggest universal connectedness. Although layering techniques are an outgrowth of well-developed twentieth-century methods and do not represent a new style, layering is a perceivable development in contemporary art characterized by a synthesis of technique and holistic thinking. Four artists, Alexander Nepote, Richard Newman, Marlene Zander Gutierrez and Martha Slaymaker, discuss their art in terms of layering.", "Are artists and electronic technology in harmony with one another? What is the character of the interface between artists and electronic technology? It is clear that electronic technology has made available to artists new modes of expressing ideas, feelings, emotions, insights, events and information and thus has expanded traditional means of artistic expression. However, the author observes, the integration of this technology into the creative process also has led to the development of a new language that provides a context for artistic expression with new modes of communication. The elements, the vocabulary, of this new language translate the nature of electronic technology into the realm of the artist, allowing the emergence of new experiential art forms. The language consists of elements that describe the creative process and influence the character of the final artwork. By means of electronic technology, this language can be used by artists to express and communicate multidimensional experiences involving sound, image and movement, permitting the expression of previously impossible syntheses and transformations of ideas. The resulting art is alive, responsive and interactive. Artists become choreographers synthesizing the numerous dimensions of human experience. The issue of how to get the spirit and soul of the artist into the computer\u2014and back out into the world\u2014is manifest in new visions of artistic expression in the electronic arts.", null, null, null, "A unique way of generating three-dimensional configurations has allowed the author to define a new self all-space filling polyhedron. Whole sequences of polyhedra are generated by this mechanism which he calls \u2018foundation sutures\u2019.

He then traces the development of his electronic drawings and describes his equipment and its practical applications.", null, "The author describes how he was led to work with kinetic electric light art objects of the Lumia type in 1954. He then discusses the problems of applying light for artistic purposes from the point of view, primarily, of his own experiences with kinetic painting systems. These include the direct transmission of light to the eye or onto a translucent screen (Lumidyne system), the production of reflected light images on a translucent screen (Reflectodyne system) and the transmission of light through polarizing material (Polaridyne system). Technical details of the systems are given and the reactions of viewers of these kinds of art objects are briefly presented.", "The artist describes his clay sculptures and aspects in which they imitate megalithic sites. These ancient sites can be considered band-pass filters, in modern electronic terminology, in that they selectively filter out irrelevant celestial information. The author's sculptures contain electronic circuits by which they detect and respond to the viewer's relative position.", "In this paper the author considers some of the issues that arise when mathematics is used to make art (predominantly visual art), in particular the possible conflicts between the role of the mathematician as artist and of the artist as mathematician. Mathematics in art can be approached in a number of ways, as analyses and \u2018simulations\u2019 of artworks and processes perhaps by artificially intelligent systems, as \u2018ready-made\u2019 mathematical objects appropriated by an artist, or as products of the creative imagination in their own right. These approaches are examined and criticised, and connections are made and used to highlight the difference between the mathematics of art and mathematics as art. The relevance of ideas in the theoretical history of computing and philosophy of mathematics is revealed and used to open up a critical context for this kind of computer art.", null, null, null, null, "The author reviews recent literature on the Golden Section and dynamic symmetry in contemporary art. Within this context, he explores the history and continuing relationship between art and science in twentieth-century art and design. He focuses on the influence of design theorist Jay Hambidge's theory of dynamic symmetry on three generations of artists by reviewing the work of selected American artists from 1920 to the present. The influence of dynamic symmetry in other fields is also examined.", "The author describes an artistic project, the objective of which is to recreate Pre-Columbian patterns and objects and give them new meaning using computer image generation techniques. The results are presented in various techniques and formats, including a series of computer-generated photographs, prints and interactive stations.", null, null, "The structural relations between pairs of tertiary colors are used to explore concord and discord in color composition. Recent demonstrations by Garau have extended these color relations to those between foreground and background, thereby enabling him to apply the structural relations between tertiaries to the conditions generating perceptual transparency. An example of paradoxical transparency in modern painting is given.", "When each element of a vertical column of lights is rapidly modulated so as to present successive slices of a two-dimensional image, the entire image can be seen by sweeping one's eyes rapidly past the column, or Lightstick.

Two research psychologists discuss the unusual visual effects produced by the Lightstick.", "In view of the unprecedented control and flexibility now offered by computers, the author discusses ideas and techniques for the fluid articulation of color in time and illustrates his concepts with recent work. Parallels with music and mathematics (fractals) are discussed concerning such musical practices as modulation and thematic transformation. The nature of dividual as opposed to individual forms is considered from the point of view of color dynamics and dimensional upgrades. Parallels with music and film are made concerning the nature of thematic dissolves. The emergence of a hypothetical language of light and sound (Orphics) is envisioned.", null, null, "This article chronicles computer programs for automated musical composition over the last 30 years, providing musical examples from 11 computer\u2013composed works. The author begins by focusing on early American efforts to impose stylistic controls through random sampling and testing, then describes European statistical approaches used until 1970. The rise of \u2018interactive\u2019 compositional utilities during the 1970s is linked to the growing proliferation of on-line computers. The current decade has been a period of eclectic interests: the resurgen\u0107e of statistical procedures, the introduction of \u2018top-down\u2019 recursive grammars, the adaptation of problem-solving techniques from Artificial Intelligence and the continuation of interactive efforts.", "The authors introduce the concepts underlying their correlation of art and music based on similarity of structures. The first section is a discourse on the aesthetic, perceptual and logical problems encountered in artistic experiments in correlation, from which several multimedia works have resulted. The aesthetic basis for a solution to these problems then is outlined, and the technical basis for realization and production of sonic-visual correlations is described.", "The paper discusses briefly kinetic painting systems that have been devised for producing a pictorial composition on a translucent flat surface that changes with time without resorting to the projection of light through film in a darkened room. The Lumidyne system developed by the author in 1956 is described in detail. Basic principles of its design, together with variations of the system, are given as well as the method of painting used by the author. Examples of several works are shown. The picture produced by the system is considered from the point of view of real motion and of change of transparent color with time. The need for aesthetic guidelines for the kinetic painter is stressed. The author concludes that the Lumidyne system, after 10 years of experience with it, is a practical, controllable and economical artistic medium.", null, null, null, "It is about 10 years since the death of Jacob Bronowski, an appropriate time to reflect on the man and his work. Bronowski's influence permeates Western civilization and is becoming part of our folk culture. We can best celebrate his life by examining his intellectual pursuits and carrying them forward.", null, "The author discusses the duality of positive and negative spaces in painting. He proposes a method of modifying negative spaces into a new pictorial field which he calls \u2018quasi-negative space\u2019. By interacting between the positive and negative spaces, the quasi-negative space can contribute to greater expressive power, to better visual balance and on some occasions to the illusion of dimensional space in an abstract painting.", "The author discusses a medium he has termed \u2018generative photography\u2019, whereby the photographic process does not simply reproduce objects, but generates new images. He traces the development of generative photography in relation to experimental photography, apparatus art and exact aesthetics, covering the period from the 1920s to the present. Examples of generative works by both established and younger artists in Germany, the United States and Poland demonstrate the traditional technological and aesthetic origins of generative photography and the emerging place of this alternative medium in those countries.

Kinetic responses were caused by density changes in liquids or expansion of wax-filled pistons exposed to the sun or by photocells controlling servo motors. Responses which ran counter to viewer expectation were frequently sought. Some issues arising from this collaboration are briefly discussed.", "The author reviews Jacob Bronowski's concept of progress based on evolution as a progression that builds biological and social forms of increasing order and complexity. The author questions Bronowski's optimism that untrammelled advance in science and technology will inevitably lead to progress. In today's age of nuclear development and genetic intervention, such advances can conceivably become anti-progressive. Natural selection, which in the past guided progressive evolution, must today be augmented by \u2018conscious selection\u2019 of advances based on human goals and values. Sensitively applied constraints on directions of science and particularly technology may be necessary means for ensuring that continuing progression will also be judged to be progress.", null, "The author has systematically explored different families of graphs produced by the combination of two pendulum motions in more or less orthogonal planes.

He outlines the important phases and periods of his artistic evolution, emphasizing his consistent quest for both rest and tension. The techniques for producing sculptural paintings are described.", null, "The author argues that one of the computer's most unique features, its ability to respond in realtime, has yet to be fully exploited. For the past 16 years he has been creating an interactive computer medium in which the computer perceives a participant's actions and responds in real-time with visual and auditory displays. He describes his conceptual discovery process as well as work in progress.", "It is helpful to view creative thinking as the manipulation of internal representations and to consider the occurrence of creative block in many cases as a relatively frequent, natural, and nonpathological process. It may therefore be appropriate to deal with creative block through methods that are not primarily therapeutic or psychoanalytic in nature, but which are intended to assist in personal decision making and problem solving. A technique called the Repertory Grid Conversation is described, and examples of its use are provided by means of two non-clinical case studies.", null, "The author describes a technique for the orchestration of color on a video screen by thematically controlling large numbers of luminous dots. The work is concerned more with how the colors radiate in a system of changing relationships than with the motions of objects in space. A series of four colors, perceived as a linear entity, is first translated into a set of rectangular modules and then dynamically articulated in time and space. Techniques of computer graphics and such related issues as perception in music and a new concept of dimensionality are discussed with the objective of outlining some new modes of picturing visual ideas.", null, "The author explains neurocosmology, his conceptual combining of neuroscience, cosmology and art to study the nature and connectedness of the brain and the universe it explores and creates.

He discusses as well his reasons and methods for integrating both artistic and scientific perspectives, emphasizing the need for a common language or system of communication between the humanities and sciences for representing ideas.", "Paintings and sculptures of the past two centuries reflect the way technology has transformed human behavior and human identity. Artists have shown technology heightening as well as diminishing human stature. In some views, humans are ennobled by their technological achievements\u2014gaining pride and dignity from great feats of engineering and mechanical expertise\u2014while in satirical art, people are depicted showing feelings of alarm and anxiety as they attempt to adapt to new machines. Twentieth-century art has sometimes suggested that humans are becoming machinelike\u2014featureless automatons who have lost their emotions and individuality. To counter dehumanization, artists often see their task as one of taming technology and using it for creative rather than destructive purposes.", "A fulcrum for much of Jacob Bronowski's writing was his conception of the integrity of science. A reading of his work, and particularly his 1956 essay \u201cThe Educated Man in 1984\u201d, allows one to resolve this conception into five components, each relevant today.", "The reported study tests the theory that the phenomenon of habituation pressures successive artists within any style to increase the impact value or arousal potential of their works. In most media, this is best accomplished by increases in the collative aspects of artworks (e.g. novelty, complexity, incongruity). These increases are achieved by movement toward more primary process cognition by successive artists during the inspirational stage of creation. When this becomes difficult, impossible or counterproductive, stylistic change occurs and the process begins anew. The theory was tested on a series of Italian paintings produced between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries. Naive subjects rated color slides of the paintings on scales designed to tap the variables of theoretical interest. Results were in conformity with theoretical predictions.", null, null, "The author conceives of the geologic structures in the Negev desert in southern Israel and the Sinai desert as \u2018launching pads\u2019 for the mind. This concept first evolved from his interpreting global plate tectonics as sculpture and then motivated him to produce a stone staircase in the Annapurna basin of the central Himalayas. The process has culminated in a project proposal to the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the execution of sculptural works by the future Mars Rovers as a first step towards sculpture on other planets in the solar system.", "The author considers the impact of technology on music and the visual arts over the past decade. He traces how photography and recording have precipitated changes and hastened the natural evolution of new forms in art and music by allowing artists to document their compositions and distribute them to wider audiences. The author then examines technology's deeper influences, as seen in audience receptivity to new art and in the changing relationships of artists and composers to their crafts. As composers and artists respond to technology\u2014by adapting their art for recording, incorporating technology into their works, or developing new forms that cannot be recorded or will not compete with the products of technology\u2014art and the artist are redefined.", "The author surveys the history of text-sound composition and its relationship to sound poetry. He describes some styles of sound poetry performance and examines the aesthetic and practical features of the technology used in sound poetry.

The use of dry copier toners allows for unlimited reworking of the surface with no fear of filling-in of the image. Removal of unsatisfactory work can be accomplished with a damp sponge, with no ghost appearing in the printed edition. Airbrushing and other difficult techniques can be used with none of the inherent problems of grease-based tusche.", "The author creates \u2018sonic structures\u2019, or music, not with the usual background and perspectives of a musician but with those of a visual artist. In this article he discusses first the historic spatial and temporal limitations of music and the visual arts. He then describes how, in his sonic and visual experiments, he has attempted to liberate these artforms from their tradition al bounds. By programming and combining the non-material elements of space, light and time as well as the concrete forms deriving from them (such as architecture, film, video, dance and literature) he has sought to bring together various disciplines that have been separated since the Renaissance.

The author discusses Bronowski's contributions and then suggests adding a third culture \u2013 the social sciences \u2013 and a half-culture \u2013 psychoanalysis, which lies on the border of science and the humanities. He concludes that, in any discussion of the three and a half cultures, Bronowski will continue to serve as an inspiration.", "The author's work is based on the idea that art is a process of constant change, as are our lives.

Director Bozo discusses the development of the museum's collection and the museum's overall plan to develop appropriate installations for both its historic collection and its contemporary galleries.", "This paper presents a pedagogical experiment that explores how three-dimensional structures acquire spatial character and qualities through the use of signs and systems. The experiment is divided into four stages: the materialization of signs, systemizing signs, structure awareness and space as meaningful structure.", "Recent American art criticism has borrowed heavily from philosophy. David Carrier describes and evaluates the work of critic Donald Kuspit. The author argues that philosophical criticism fails to do justice to the specifically artistic features of the work it describes; Kuspit's book on the painter Leon Golub does not indicate what is original and important in that artist's work. Kuspit's work is contrasted with the philosophical criticism of Rosalind Krauss, which, it is argued, provides an original and provocative analysis of philosophical issues.", "After briefly discussing creativity in art and science, the author examines various factors that either favor or impede the attribution of merit, or perceived value, to works of art and science.", "The author reviews both the historical contribution of abstract expressionism in which the technique of action painting is employed and visual perception as it applies to a basic appreciation of nonfigurative art. This is followed by a discussion of his paintings in which he combines the traditions and techniques of American abstract expressionism and Byzantine and Russian iconography using a combination of action painting and precise brushwork.

A comparison of works in several media suggests a convergence of expansionist sculpture and reductionist theater. He identifies several factors that must be considered in attempting to formulate distinctions between these genre.", "What can we learn about art by analyzing the art market? The author offers a skeptical argument. Judgements of aesthetic value change with time. Since those changes reflect market value, perhaps we can show that aesthetic value is market value. The critic, we would then believe, seeks to persuade us that art has aesthetic value, for our beliefs about art's value depend upon a consensus established in part by the critic. Recently some critics and philosophers have argued that the traditions of art are dead. The prospects for such an \u2018aesthetic atheism\u2019 in relation to this skeptical argument are discussed.", "Computer graphics can be used effectively to teach the visual comprehension of four spatial dimensions. This visual comprehension, necessary for the creation of accurate geometric models of events in space\u2013time physics, can be employed in works of art by simple formal means. The artist explains the use of two and three-dimensional elements to create the visual information of four dimensions in his paintings.", null, "The author has researched and developed a theory of computation for caricature and has implemented this theory as an interactive computer graphics program. The Caricature Generator program is used to create caricatures by amplifying the differences between the face to be caricatured and a comparison face. This continuous, parallel amplification of facial features on the computer screen simulates the visualization process in the imagination of the caricaturist.

Visual imagery provides a context within which to explore the apparent confrontation between science and the media which is here presented as based on the relationship between image and reality. This link generates the associated but distinct notions of sight, perception and conception, and forms the groundwork for the author's argument centred on illusion and delusion. Alternative sensor systems to the eye are shown to have a significant influence on our image of the world, and it follows that image manipulations (analysis, enhancement, distortion) have a tangible impact on perception. It thus becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between objective and subjective worlds or between the underlying standards of scientist and artist.

It is argued that the most recent developments in micro-electronics have made computer art accessible to a large number of artists and amateurs. As a result, computer graphics will play an increasing role in studies of the theory of art, in education, and in entertainment, as well as in the shaping of the visual environment. Initial applications of computer graphics to traditional two-dimensional formats have now been superseded by more revolutionary modes of expression.

The central principle that moves our society is the demand that the basis of action shall be verifiable knowledge. This is a public knowledge that is open to the scrutiny of every member of society and has come to be called science.To test impersonally what is conjectured requires mechanical laboratory apparatus but mechanical watchdogs against bias have nothing to do with the content of knowledge. By the end of the 19th century a scientist had come to be regarded as a living extension of his own apparatus and it was expected that in time he would prove that man is a machine also. The author believes that this image has had the catastrophic consequence of provoking irrational crusades against all technology. In order to overcome this situation, intellectuals, artists above all, must shape a new imagery of science as understood in the 20th century-science cannot have the inhuman, mechanical kind of exactness ascribed to it in the 19th century and he gives reasons why this is so.The preoccupations of science have been moving from physics to biology, a historical subject. Man's evolution has been culture-driven and a central component in the ascent of man has been the manipulation of mental imagery and its expression in language and other symbolisms. Art is a powerful mover of the mind, for it helps to project thoughts forward, to form plans and to enlarge knowledge. For problems of conduct, general plans or grand strategies are devised that are called human values. Thus values are now seen as an integral part of the biological nature of man, of which the search for knowledge is a biological necessity.", null, null, "The artist describes his work with Terrain Instruments, sound-monitoring. constructions and installations in the landscape and explains how they differ from traditional musical instruments and sculpture.

A study of his landscape sites shows that their organization is only in part imposed. The main objects are taken with surprising literalness from the structure of the motif, while textures are generally ordered by a synthetic process to resonate with the objects. Only by adhering to the structure of the motif does C\u00e9zanne release his synthetic capacities. Three suggestions about his personal functioning are made to account for this adherence: strength gained from passiveness in some of his interpersonal relations, dependence on outside structures for his inner equilibrium, and a search for clear relationships in visual reality as symbols of ideal ones in his inner world.", "Surfaces generated by straight lines are called ruled surfaces. Ruled surfaces are easily constructed of rods, wire or line into objects that illustrate complex mathematical symmetries.

Subjects discussed in this connection include; joining stereograms with sculptural materials; the relation of the stereogram projection and film support structure to the piece as a whole; how stereograms shift in relation to fixed objects: the use of found (ready-made) stereograms; ways of altering stereograms by cutting or bending the film sheet, or masking the image with light.", "Three of Cubism's derivatives\u2014Futurism, Precisionism, Suprematism\u2014played important roles in shaping the avant-garde cinema of the 1920s.

Sedgwick has proposed that the horizon may provide the basis for important informational structures, and a new experiment is described which indicates that the horizon is indeed an effective source of information in pictures. We were, however, prompted to reconsider Gibson's claim that pictures contain information of a kind available in the optic array.

In particular, the model illustrated in the literature on the subject indicating uniform growth is taken a step further in generality to indicate non-uniform growth.The intention has been to arrive at a wholly visual statement. And yet the mathematical approach is integral to this end. The study of flower forms becomes a study of the relation between the circle and the golden ratio.A computerised drawing system was used to draw forms that are algebraically defined.

However, a remarkable number of artists have remained intensely committed to the veristic. Their written philosophies form a foundation for others to build upon in evaluating the movement. It is suggested that perhaps only through the words of contemporary veristic surrealists can a renewed appreciation of their work be realized and that in these artist-generated writings a rich and viable literature of aesthetics survives a period of misunderstanding.", "The author briefly reviews the recent development of Computer Art. He considers some of the aesthetic issues raised, including play with human control/noncontrol, interest in sets of possibilities rather than any particular manifestation, the blurring of the distinction between object and process and the reduction of the barrier between computer artists and viewers of their works.

A review of the properties of free and encapsulated liquid crystals is given with emphasis on practical aspects of interest to artists. The increased color gamut and change of color with angle of viewing and ambient temperature are explained. It is shown to be possible to express several aspects or experiences of the the same theme as the angle of viewing or the temperature changes. In a sculpture or relief coated with liquid crystals, inclined planes and curved surfaces are accentuated by a shift in color, as they are seen from a more oblique angle than the surfaces facing the viewer. Unlike with pigments, a layer of liquid crystals is nearly transparent to white light. Only a narrow band of wavelength is reflected and it appears as a relatively pure and saturated color. A great range of color combinations can be created by superimposing two or more colored layers. As the colors of the liquid crystals add, as in the case for colored lights, they open up interesting possibilities for new artistic expression.

His general conclusion is that these two kinds of perspective convey the geometry of visual perception of nearby objects more accurately than does geometrical or linear (scientific) perspective developed during the Renaissance period. He points out that inverted perspective exaggerations that can be found occasionally in pictorial art do not refute his general conclusion about the validity of inverted perspective for the depiction of nearby objects.", "The basic theory of linear perspective is reviewed, and it is shown that a perspective picture implies the existence of a unique point in space which is, on optical grounds, the preferred viewpoint of the picture. The concepts of the visible, terrestrial, and sensible horizons are then compared, and it is found that the horizon in a picture can give the vertical position of the viewpoint. The outside knowledge or assumptions which are necessary in order completely to determine the preferred viewpoint are then considered. The assumptions used here are based on common knowledge of the three-dimensional shapes and orientations of pictured objects and knowledge of the picture-making processes. A step-by-step procedure is then given for finding the location of the preferred viewpoints of one-, two- and three-point perspectives. It is found that a three-point perspective provides more information about the viewpoint, with fewer assumptions, than either of the other two cases.

Among the kinetic works described are an outdoor installation involving the programmed projection of coloured light on walls, intercepted by passers-by who cast coloured shadows; an installation presenting projections on fabric sails; an audio-kinetic lightshow, and kinetic electric light objects that utilise dichroic filters to produce divergent beams of complementary colours.

It outlines at least three forms of flexibility which may be characteristic of the artist. First, artists appear able to access primitive feelings and memories which are preserved in their unconscious. Second, artists appear able to access perceptual modes and alternate between physical-sensory and object information. This enables them to grasp the world from a new vantage point. Third, artists canfunctionally separate stimulus input (\u2018seeing as\u2019 mode) from motor output (\u2018seeing that\u2019 mode) which makes it possible to recreate their new perceptions or images in a concrete work. The fact that these last two skills can be described in the language of experimental psychology suggests that they are amenable to empirical investigation.

The former possess rigorous experimental paradigms anda broad theoretical framework which relates the person to the environment.

In order to explain the way in which dream images are produced, Freud introduced the concept of dream-work; it is proposed that a comparable concept\u2014art-work\u2014would be useful in the field of artistic production. Freud made frequent use of the pictorial analogy in discussing the mechanisms of dream construction; this paper reverses the dream picture relationship and examines, via a number of concrete examples, the extent to which pictures can be elucidated by the terms condensation, displacement, etc. which Freud employed to explain dreams.

As an aesthetic object, it was to be a symbol of transnational poetic creativity endeavoring to transform the everyday, to disclose more of the world, and to bring creative possibility to fruition.

Coupled with this are other informal beliefs about intuition. This paper assesses these beliefs. Intuition is analyzed as cognition without reasons and argued to be closely related to perception. While some might think that intuition represents a rare or special mode of cognition, much of perceiving amounts to intuiting. Though intuition often serves where reasons offer little help, just the opposite frequently occurs. Intuition is not endowed with special certainty. Intuition does bear a special kind of relevance, but not a special degree of relevance, in making value judgments in the arts. A laboratory analysis of the thoughts expressed by poets and artists while at work suggests that their value judgments most often carry reasons; in this sense their work is nonintuitive. But intuition usually supports these reasons. Finally, far from being at odds, reasoning and intuition seem to be complementary in the complex process of making art.", null, "The author outlines significant events leading to governmental art patronage in Britain.

The nature of this new relationship between artists, middlemen and the general public tends to be obscured or ignored by traditional art scholarship that analyzes styles and schools of art mainly in terms of pre-capitalist economics. The history of art as a discipline does not seem capable of dealing with new artistic technologies and new relationships between artists, art consumers and the modern impressarios of mass culture who have no obvious counterparts in European history during the main periods into which art history has been divided. As a result, art historical writing and teaching fail to provide the public with adequate conceptual tools to deal with the present significance of art.By treating the history of contemporary art much as it treats medieval or Renaissance art, historians continue to emphasize the privileged character of art objects and their status as a precious commodity in a market of fluctuating pecuniary values. Unfortunately, this approach does not come to grips with the character of inexpensively reproduced imagery as it affects the behavior of members of the general public.

The first involves the moral judgment of the art object itself and raises empirical and philosophical questions. The second, less often pondered but no less puzzling, concerns moral issues that center around the artist as an individual. The author therefore proceeds to identify three distinguishable types of moral demand that may be placed on artists: first, demands that are held to apply to everyone as a moral being and, therefore, apply equally to artists; second, demands that apply particularly but not exclusively to artists as socal participants, with certain significant controls and influence; and third, those that apply uniquely to artists, since these demands derive from the peculiar character of the tasks and powers of artists. The principal intent of this paper is to pursue and illuminate these types of moral demand, particularly the third, and to examine their interrelationships.", null, null, null, null, null, null, "The problem of pictorial representation is partly a philosophical, partly an empirical one. Specifically, how can X represent Y; how can X be perceived as something other than what it is?

It is proposed that rather than similar visual features of X and Y, it is parts of identical attentional acts during the perception of the features that constitute their relationship and that the traditional concept of representation in visual art is misleading.

The consequences of viewing perspective pictures from a position other than the projection point are analyzed. The evidence for the intelligibility of pictures, including those in perspective, to naive viewers is discussed. He concludes that, although a perspective picture normally seen does not duplicate the scene that it depicts (viewers are aware that they are looking at a flat surface as well as a depicted space), its perception does not require any learning other than learning to discriminate between information for flatness, which is supplied by surface relationships and information for depth in the form of invariant relationships, which is provided by the artist.", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, "The author describes his aesthetic use of glass and other materials to convey his ideas and feelings to viewers of his work.

The phenomenon of contrast, so well exemplified by works of Claude Monet and Josef Albers, is cited as evidence of nonconstancy. Experimentally observed response of individual retinal cells to very small light beams is used to support the principle of retinal antagonistic organization as applied in color vision and is extended to spatial hue and lightness contrast.

The Chinese seek to temporize conflicts and to search for nonviolent solutions. They seem to make an all-out effort to obtain reconciliation that does not cause either party to lose face.

The materials used range from clay, plaster, Styrofoam slabs and wire to stone and wood. The aim of the course is to introduce students to three-dimensional art, in order to counteract the influence of the mass media, such as photography, cinema and television, which tend to have a \u2018flattening\u2019 influence on people.", "The author points out that the application of the science of color to art probably had its beginning during the schools of Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism in France. In the 19th century, scientists like M. E. Chevreul, James Clerk Maxwell, Hermann von Helmholtz and Ogden N. Rood fostered new principles drawn from physiological optics. In the 20th century, came Op art that took cues from psychology, but which dealt mostly with optical phenomena, that is, with ways in which the retina and lens of the eye handled color stimuli.This article deals with color effects that carry on through the eye itself, up the optic nerve and into the brain, the seat of perception. The brain may well interpret what the eye sees in singular ways. Of particular significance is awareness of the fact, as pointed out by David Katz, that in human vision there is an independent sense of illumination. Exploitation of this sense gives promise of new modes of color expression for the future.", null, "The author discusses the part of philosophy called aesthetics and points out the difference between factual science and the philosophy of essence. He finds that the philosophy of essence is of no use in helping artists or other creative individuals to find really valuable paths to follow among the vast number of theoretically possible paths. He finds that such guidance can be found only through a better understanding of relevant facts by resorting to controlled experiments.The difficulties of applying the principal method of science to experimental aesthetics are reviewed and some of the positive achievements of this new science are mentioned. He finds that it is the right and duty of those working in experimental aesthetics to take advantage of the knowledge accumulated by experimental psychologists in collaboration with physiologists, biologists and mathematicians. He ends with the hope that the science of art will become a part of the science of human behavior.", null, null, null, null, "The author is interested in showing to the public the visual aesthetic qualities of natural phenomena that can be produced through the use of high-voltage electricity.

As regards the forming of the plastic, he particularly describes methods of twisting and bending the material when it is softened by heating. He does not employ casting techniques, which consist of making plastic sculpture in a mold from the monomer, because the technical difficulties and expense preclude optically satisfactory massive castings. He describes in detail his making of a recent piece entitled \u2018Implication\u2019 that has a body of smoky transparent Plexiglas mounted on an anodized aluminum base. His principal aim in making acrylic sculpture is the preservation and extension of the marvellous capacity of Plexiglas to activate light aesthetically.", "The author carried out a survey in 1970 among 108 viewers of four of his paintings of different figurative subjects. He considers the sample he chose to be representative of the population of the city of Montpellier, France, where the study was made. The purpose of the survey was to learn to what extent those interviewed were capable of recognizing and interpreting the subject matter. His belief was confirmed that communication between artists and the general public is greatly handicapped by its ignorance of artistic codes artists use (many of the codes having a long history) and its belief that only some subjects are suitable for art, which prevents the recognition of unexpected or unpalatable content.

Man is being subjected in his daily life to uncertainties and changes that lie beyond his optimum perceptual rate. At the same time, urban environment is being constructed that offers no nourishment to the mind. New construction replacing older buildings invariably manifests a sharp drop in density of interest. The result is a tendency for people to operate within an environment on an increasingly subliminal level of awareness. The mechanics of the brain and its preference for system-maximization give discreet support to this tendency.He believes that the importance of urban design is that it can offer mental stimulation at a level compatible with the optimum perceptual rate, so that the mind does not withdraw, either because of monotony or of sensory overload. To this end, sculpture has a vital role to play, because of its intrinsic interest and its testament to values other than pure utilitarianism. It raises the visual interest of a place, it undermines the incipient tendency of the mind to capitulate to system-maximization. He gives examples of the effective use of sculpture in an urban setting in Europe in the past and in the present.", "The contributions that have been made by psychologists, anthropologists and others to the revision of our traditional concepts of space demand, in the author's view, a new approach to urban design, architecture and art. These contributions suggest that two basic categories of space must be distinguished: the physical and the mental. Mental space is shown not to have a one-to-one correspondence with the space that is part of the physical world, due to the mediation of various psychological and cultural factors. A concept of space may be said to originate in an observer's mind and is a structure that is imposed on the physical world. The author discusses how concepts of space have been found to differ on a cultural basis and he gives some examples of how they have influenced urban design, architecture and art in various cultures. To analyse this relationship further, mental space has been sub-divided into three major types: the biological, the symbolic and the mathematical. Specific examples are given of these as they have been embodied in the layout of towns, building design and painting.", null, null, null, null, null, "The author discusses and analyzes the validity of a suggested possibility of a theory of \u2018black\u2019 aesthetics, a minor aspect in the domain of art of the major social upheaval in the U.S.A. involving Afro-Americans. He concludes that though there is a limited sense in which \u2018black\u2019 aesthetics can be used as a concept, this sense is trivial and inconsequential. He finds no serious, supportable meaning of a theory of \u2018black\u2019 aesthetics as distinguished from general aesthetic theory, any more than there is one of a theory of, for example, \u2018white\u2019 organic chemistry or of \u2018Indian\u2019 trigonometry.", null, "The author presents a justification for the particular approach to art criticism and popularization used to guide the series of exhibitions on \u2018Art and Society\u2019 organized by the Welsh Arts Council.

In connection with these exhibitions, the author, alone or with a co-author, has written books on these subjects.He points out that a new model of culture is needed to replace the \u2018aristocratic\u2019 one of culture moving from a \u2018high\u2019 to a \u2018low\u2019 level of society. The exhibitions and the books, therefore, were designed to be deliberately entertaining and to make clear the functional interdependence of art and life. They brashly confront the public with ephemera-like seaside postcards or patriotic corsets from World War I alongside painting and sculpture.He concludes by saying that either a fluid, broadening definition of art related to the mass media of today as well as to the aristocratic media of the past must be developed or the continued use of a narrow concept that will become steadily more remote from the cultural questions of a technological world must be accepted.", null, null, "A line of artistic enquiry has emerged from the application of self-referential principles in the author's teaching.

Recent students of the subject agree, however, that these \u2018play theories\u2019 of art are inadequate to deal fully with the varieties of artistic activity.The author examines similarities between art (including both artistic creation and aesthetic experience) and play, and offers a hypothesis that concerns the origins of artistic activity using ethological concepts. The relationship between play and art is considered phylogenetically, i.e. art is said to have originated as a kind of play, gradually over millenia acquiring its own independence and individuality. In order for an evolutionary characteristic to be selected for, it must have adaptive value for the species and the author's reason for believing that art has this property is that it enhances both man's sociality and his self-assertion.

In such conditions, concern has been felt for the fate of the arts and of art education in the Third World. It seems possible that practical and utilitarian subjects may crowd out aesthetic interests.The author's purpose was to explore the development of art education over the past century in one such emergent nation. Trinidad was selected because of the writer's association with its educational system over the past seventeen years as an art teacher and also as a secondary school principal in two different communities.A three-fold method of investigation was used: documentary evidence, interviews and visits to schools of various types.

As a young artist, he noted that plastic art had been dissected and he concluded that it was necessary to reunite the parts. He set as one of his objectives the surpassing of individual style.He discusses certain elements of his work that have been of special concern to him during the past few years. The first concerns the representation of reality by drawing and watercolour painting where shapes relate only partly to preconceived structures. The second concerns his style where he requires equal weight be given to different forms and to different colors in a picture.

That is, odor perception seems to result from a much more complex response than a simple one-to-one correspondence between the receptor sites and the molecular structure of the stimulant.Odor perception is considered by the author in analogy to a semantic information-conveying system. In animals, odor message interpretation is instinctive and fixed. At the human level some or all stimuli to the odor receptors have changing, contextual meaning. Their meaning can be modified by habit or by learning.The author postulates that sensory excitation due to pure chemical substances is similar to that due to words.

Traditionally, art is taught in individual subjects but the proposed training is integrative, a concept usually reserved for training advanced students. The course, in line with the painter's process, alternates constantly between freedom and control.The professional, after years of trial and error, is able to juggle and integrate all of the visual elements at one time\u2014colors, shapes, light and dark values, lines and textures. Mastering this difficult integrative process is made possible for the amateur by limiting the media and techniques, stripping the procedures to the minimum and organizing their sequence. Control is established by confining attention to one visual element at a time and building one upon the other. The proposed training advances by means of an integrated interplay between work from the imagination, analysis of the works of masters and critical examination of student work. Three-dimensional factors are purposely postponed until the two-dimensional process is mastered. Concurrently, amateur preconceptions and prejudices are faced squarely to develop objective judgment and artistic taste.", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, "The author describes how he came to make sculpture inspired by furniture, in particular, furniture of the American Colonial period.

An important start has been made in the establishment of oil paint standards but some manufacturers do not meet them. The technological aspects of acrylic paint are more complex, yet no action appears to be underway in establishing standards for them. Artists should now demand and receive the best quality paint that modern technology can provide.The author describes his experiences in making paintings from a chemist's point of view.

The present paper, based on a report given at a Unesco meeting on the humanistic and social-science education of engineers, exemplifies some recent developments in engineering education in the U.S.A. Various experimental programs, now under way, are designed to lead engineering students towards a greater consciousness of the social implications of their future professional work and to explore ways in which they can cope with this new range of problems confronting them.

The structure of a pattern expresses the relations between the elements of a pattern, which the author demonstrates.The scientist searches for patterns and relations among observations; to this purpose he systematizes his observations.

The high points of his architectural career are mentioned from the points of view of the use of sculpture in architecture and of architecture as sculpture. Jacobsen whenever possible insisted on having control of the overall concept of a building, including interior design and decoration, and landscaping. He brought in consultants at an early stage of each project to advise him on the use of sculpture and on other aspects making up a complete building. His own interest in design ranged from kitchen and bathroom fittings to tableware to machinery to book covers.Some felt that to achieve his target Jacobsen developed a cold manner in order to dictate to clients the precise environment in which they were to work or live.

He claims that art has largely ignored the fact that man is a binocular species who perceives space stereoscopically. The author points out the analogies between visual stereo space, color perception and binaural sound perception. The possible relationship between stereo cues and biologically inherited sensitivities, on the one hand, and sensory cultural habits, on the other hand, is also examined.

He avoids a subjective approach in favor of a more technical discussion of concepts and methodology.

The inhibitory mechanisms employed perform also steering functions. In stress situations, behavior based on inhibition takes the form of flight\u2014according to Cannon's hypotheses. Natural caves offered man a passive way to escape from existential stress. For the primitive nervous system, cave-dwelling would represent sensory deprivation. This would lead, as recent research has shown, to the occurrence of projective hallucinations. Persons with tendencies to introversion and with better developed nervous systems can control these hallucinations and transform them into creative action, such as painting. Art, assumed by the author to have originated in this way, is an important antidote for overcoming the monotony of living in a cave.As man becomes more independent of nature, past, present and future, memory and foresight gain increasing importance. The author proposes the hypothesis that the plastic fine arts were also developed to cope with his consciousness of time. Painting is concerned with the events of the present, architecture with those involving the time unit of the year and sculpture with death and eternity.In periods when one of the three time aspects becomes dominant, the art corresponding to that particular aspect becomes central. In addition and as a consequence of dominance, the functions of the other arts may be transformed, giving rise to a mixture of them (mixed media).", null, null, "The author discusses the use of fluorescent pigments in his paintings.

He regards form as a property which may objectively be correlated with the elements of which a work of art is composed and that, as regards the status of form, art and science are closely allied. When form is properly abstracted from a work of art it represents underlying artistic processes which it is the enterprise of criticism to elucidate, which leads me to suppose that critics might profitably study the science of biological form. The process by which the scientist attributes form to a natural object involves the creative imagination and requires him to exercise powers of visualization of the highest order. It is this visual element, dependent upon the faculty of perception, that lays science open to the influence of the general culture of its time, for we all learn to see in ways that are conditioned by educational institutions, popular media, and the fine arts.The author reviews the use of biological forms by artists during past centuries in Europe and states that in the late nineteenth century many of the leading biologists were artists. Carl Chun, the marine zoologist, adorned his house with frescoes. Theodor Boveri, the embryologist, painted fine landscapes in oil. Haeckel and Doflein did watercolors. In the decades following, generalized organic forms came to figure prominently as motifs in art. They have been used, for example, by Klee, Kandinsky, Gorky, Tanguy and Miro.The interdependence of art and science was great enough over that half century to call for much closer study than it has so far received. In more recent times the biologist has become more sure of the character of structure. The scope for imaginative conjecture has contracted with the development of powerful analytic tools such as the scanning electron microscope. The author suspects that the study of behaviour and the complexity of environmental relations may prove to be areas where strong interactions between art and science will continue to occur.Form, however, is only one aspect, albeit a highly important one, of the interdependence of art and science within the framework of a common culture.", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, "The author feels that a change in the traditional program for educating artists is necessary.

He suggests a new four-year curriculum to hopefully correct the deficiencies of present programs. The first year would provide a foundation in broad liberal studies together with a background in studio work.

He describes characteristics of paintings and compares them to mental images that have been studied by psychologists.He shows, in particular, how sketches are a more faithful representation of mental images than \u2018finished\u2019 paintings. He also points out that the often indefinite quality and the absence of detail in sketches correspond more closely to perception and imagination. From the psychology of perception it is known that a person fixes his gaze on only certain portions of an object at the moment he perceives it and that details of an object cannot be grasped in one's imagination. In their sketches painters rediscover the pristine human element that lies beyond the attitudes and prejudices of their era.Scientific reasoning is generally accompanied and supported by mental images. The author shows how the composition of the \u2018Adoration of the Magi\u2019 by Leonardo da Vinci corresponds to this type of image.He discusses characteristics of colors and of composition in paintings that represent mental images. He finds that the colors of a mental image of an object are independent of the real object. The importance of gesture in sketches is considered from the point of view that mental images have at the same time a kinesthetic property.Finally, the author attempts to determine the criteria for deciding whether a painting is based on sensation, memory or imagination.

Art which is subject to change must also be apprehended as a total structure. The author believes that if the total structure cannot be perceived at a single moment, then it is necessary that past moments be remembered with some degree of completeness. Those elements in a work which are remembered, form a sub-structure upon which the less stable, textural elements rest. By and large, a painting is accessible as a total structure at any single moment of time. The multiple structural possibilities implicit in a non-kinetic work of art are a result of the viewer's ability to impose his own time sequence upon the work. The dynamics of the viewer's time sequence, set against the more stable structure of the picture, are the basis of contemplation.The illusionistic depth in a painting is heightened when stereoptic techniques and dynamic changes of focal points are employed. The focus mechanism of the eye differs in an important way from that of the camera.If a picture is viewed obliquely, the spatial possibilities of the composition are multiplied. In a rotating, ceiling-hung painting, a number of devices which expand the possibilities of relationship are introduced into painting. As a painting rotates, forms seem to shrink and expand, and forms assume different spatial positions. The far side of the painting may appear to be near side, and the direction of rotation may seem to change. Since points on a rotating plane increase in actual speed as they approach the circumference of the circle, while at the same time, centers of the viewer's interest tend to become centers of implied rotation as well, various kinetic and spatial interpretations of a single work are possible. Because of these changes in the perception of the painting, while the painting itself does not change, the criteria for contemplation described above are met.", "Scientific research is in many ways similar to art, in the sense that like art it appeals to an aesthetic sense.

Some examples are given in the article.It is particularly interesting to compare hidden forms, revealed to us by the most advanced instruments, with the creations of non-figurative artists. The comparison sometimes brings out surprising convergences between scientific photography and the products of painters and architects. The convergences are often found in works of art earlier than in scientific photographs relating to matter, as if the artist found within himself, in his projection on canvas, the forms nature reveals when examined in the finest detail.The author asks what could be the origin of the convergence: chance, knowledge of the progress in science or intuitive discovery of forms that reflect an aesthetic sense based on principles of efficiency and balance, as if there were in the artist a kind of subconscious foreknowledge enabling him to divine the architecture and harmony of matter?

La peinture abstraite est, par contre, la repr\u00e9sentation des structures de l'esprit \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat pur, et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 devient image mentale lorsqu'elle acquiert ces structures par l'interm\u00e9diaire des sensations.

Also, the author describes the influence upon him of examples of Chinese paintings and his method of working with mounted layers of torn papers.Both the similarities as well as the differences to Cubism in his style are described in detail, with the hope that the structural content of his work will be understood and even more valued than its social message.", null, null, "This article is a non-technical introduction to cybernetics, the study of \u2018control and communication in the animal and the machin\u00e9\u2019.

Bionics, cybernation and artificial intelligence (which especially involves heuristic programming) are all fields concerned with the development of such hardware systems.It is argued that cybernetics is related to art in three ways: it may be used by the scientist in studying art, it may be used by the artist in creating works of art\u2014and may have been one of the influences behind the development of the idea of machines as works of art and machines for creating art, as well as the increasingly process-oriented nature of contemporary art\u2014and finally cybernetics may itself be regarded in certain respects as an art form in its own right.", null, null, null, "The artist gives an account of his process in making a painting to the extent of the factors of which he is conscious.

He believes that an artist who cannot feel the difference, for example, between various wave shapes lacks a most valuable sensibility.The subject of his painting \u2018Transformations\u2019 was determined by his interest in various wave forms.

Before describing the process used in the making of the picture, he discusses the human preference for directions towards the right rather than to the left and from the top downwards rather than from the bottom upwards. By the use of these preferences or asymmetries he believes that a static painting can give an illusion of motion, provided that the eyes can be compelled to follow simultaneously two lines at different speeds.In the final section he describes in detail the seven steps which made up the process he used in making the painting.He concludes by stating that \u2018Transformations\u2019 might on the one hand transmit to an observer the relationship between the painting and various kinds of wave patterns in nature.

In first making the change from figurative to non-figurative presentations in his sculpture, the artist limits himself to the use of cubic-like geometric volumes.

From this format he moves to one in which the axes of all volumes are at angles with the vertical and the horizontal and, further, explores the inverted pyramid type image. Through all these compositions he integrates the volumes by means of an interlocking and overlapping treatment. In this way he avoids the mere juxtaposition or piling of shapes one on top of the other like children's building blocks.Cubic-like shapes are ideally suited for exploring new sculpture arrangements. In the first place, they afford an artist a ready means for establishing volume or mass in his compositions.

The information from recent ethological studies, which examines the similarities between animal and human behavior, should interest the artist and augment his intuitive capacity to create aesthetic form.Many factors are involved in the evolutionary changes of most animal species. One factor that has guided the development of animal and human behavior is called selection pressure. An example of selection pressure is the need for social communication for sexual reproduction and group protection. Another category of selection pressure resides in the various dangerous animals and predators that impinge on the survival of particular animal groups. So intense is predator selection pressure that some animal species appear to have evolved unlearned recognition and avoidance of predators.The visual cues for both social signals and predator recognition are termed \u2018releasers\u2019 because they evoke a somewhat stereotyped reaction when viewed by certain animals. Man was certainly exposed to specific selection pressures during his long evolutionary history, and, as a result, he uses intricate social signals, such as facial expressions and body postures, for communicating emotional states during interpersonal contact. The spontaneous fear exhibited by man to snakes, scorpions and other insects with many legs suggests that these avoidance responses represent emotional by-products for survival purposes-residual from an earlier evolutionary period.If the artist desires to create an exciting piece of art, he might consider using various releasers and selected social signals to enhance the visual impact of his work. Some of the visual releasers that will be discussed comprise paired concentric circles, serrated contours and linear bands that exhibit high conspicuousness.The artist can attempt to control the viewer's arousal by selecting visual releasers that will evoke the desired response.", "Following the rupture with the past in the visual arts, contemporary music too has broken violently with tradition in the last 40 years. The palette of sound possibilities has been radically increased\u2014including electronic sounds and noise\u2014and with the new theories and techniques have come equally radical changes in musical notation. Some of the changes have been functional and essential, some have been extremist and exaggerated. The illustrations\u2014the graphic pictures used as scores\u2014show the extent of freedom and responsibility given to the performers and to chance. The resemblance of some of the scores to the work of painters of the last decades, such as Mondrian, Miro and Klee is striking.The new notation has aroused much dissent and opposition as well as support. Exhibitions have been given of \u2018graphic scores\u2019, numerous analytical articles have been written; publishers protest because of the greatly increased cost in beginning from scratch for each score; there is no standardization of indications for special effects; conductors and performers find the \u2018realization\u2019 of the scores extremely difficult and time-consuming.One writer, Karl Roschitz, clarifies the purpose of this new graphic notation in these terms: \u201cThe essential condition of these \u201coptical transcriptions\u201d, apart from questions of passing fashion, is the constant desire to find for the work to be performed and interpreted a method of fixation, so to speak, \u201cadapted to the material\u201d and which thereby gives the interpreter a clear, transparent and complete picture of the work as well as of the events and problems which are its \u201ckey\u201d \u2026 on these scores are indicated only the purely approximative musical \u201cevolutions and developments\u201d\u2014evolutions intended to make the performer himself discover and make felt the facets and relations of sound, of perpetually new sound events.\u201dThe writer poses the question of whether these graphic scores may not be regarded with more interest for their visual appeal in the future than for the music which they are intended to communicate.

Still contemporary architects and builders of our cities have not yet understood that the close association of glass painting with architecture enhances the latter. The author points out that the capabilities of stained glass have not yet been fully explored, and that they are challenging to the contemporary artist. For many centuries artists neglected or ignored the innate possibilities of this medium, and glass painting was done in the same manner as oil painting.Different techniques which the author has employed are described. She stresses that in many of her glass paintings the lines of the leading are used as part of the design to make graphic structures between the plates of colored glass. Her use of antique glass is related to its textures, different thicknesses and varying tonalities. Other methods are mentioned as to how desired textures can be produced and the way in which both opaque and transparent glass, as well as fused glass, are employed in her work.The author shows that electrically illuminated glass paintings do not necessarily need an architectural setting and that glass paintings, when installed in a room of a museum, in an entrance hall or in a private home, can provide the splendor of light and color. Rooms providing an interplay of light and color and an atmosphere conducive to meditation are considered by the author of particular need in our time for mental relaxation, better concentration, valuable visual experience and pleasure. The author also proposes ceiling murals, made of stained glass, evenly lit from above.The creative process of paintings of stained glass is the same as in all the arts. The author expresses the belief that, in spite of current trends to overemphasise the creative process, it is the finished work of art which, as in the past, will determine its merits, regardless whether or not it has been appreciated in the time it was created.Finally, she points out that in glass paintings it is the light, whether natural or artificial, that is the most important element: for it appears as if the source of light is in the colored glass itself and one has the feeling of being taken into distant space.", null, null, null, "L'absence d'une formation et l'absence d'une m\u00e9thode semblent \u00eatre \u00e0 la base de ce qu'on peut appeler aujourd'hui la maladie de la critique d'art.

He notes that engineers, who might be expected to develop into leaders of technology, are, on the whole, failing to do so in the United States today.In order to clarify the relationships between the various elements of technology, a diagram is presented showing the interconnections between the elements, both as regards the social and physical environment and their own special character.The author is of the view that at the present time American institutions of higher education are devoting too much attention to the training of basic and applied scientists, and neglecting the development of adequately qualified engineers and technologists. He does not mean to imply that a broad background in science, mathematics and the humanities is not essential, for it is required by modern engineering and technology.He finds that proven men of action in technology have given little thought to measures for improving the situation, mainly because they are too busy with their own projects. They have resigned this responsibility to teachers and researchers in basic and applied sciences who, having both time and enthusiasm, proceed to crowd out engineering subjects rather than improve them to match the requirements of rapidly changing technology.He recommends that institutions for producing professional engineers and technologists be planned and established along current academic lines except for an increased emphasis on the preparation of students for real-world practice as is done, for example, by faculties of law and medicine.In conclusion, the author cites his experience of some thirty years in directing the Instrumentation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he believes would be effective as one model of such institutions.", null, "The author discusses briefly the present limited understanding of the aesthetic qualities of an art object conceived as a set of quantities (elements and relationships).The possibilities of organizing simple forms is demonstrated and illustrated with diagrams and the author's own works\u2014relief structures made from industrial materials (transparent and opaque plastics and metalic sheet, polished and matt surfaces).The author expresses the hope that visual art will become a form of communication through sensation that will influence functions in a rational manner rather than through the appeal to magic or indulging the artist with misplaced reverence.", null, null, "The evolution of the study of creativity as a real interdisciplinary subject is now becoming importantly evident. Better and fresher perspective in both technology and the arts may be secured through the concept of the innovational chain, which is concerned with the entire sequence of events from the original invention to its impact on society.In this broader framework of reference, many of the views on similarities and differences between the arts and the sciences can be advantageously reassessed. The creativity involved in the \u2018art of technology\u2019 and the \u2018technology of art\u2019 may reflect a basic duality and reciprocity and not a mere felicitous turn of phrase.Obsolescing attitudes such as those dependent on the archaic role of definitions and dichotomies stand in the way of the new evolution in creativity. Simple devices which, in the words of Leonardo, \u2018may appear trivial and almost ludicrous\u2019 are \u2018nevertheless of great utility in arousing the mind to various inventions\u2019.In this larger sense, creativity in technology and creativity in the arts are but different manifestations of invention.", null, null, null, null, "It is unusual today for anyone engaged in one particular field to write about another, but new developments in any particular field only become part of general culture when they enter the experience of people not specializing in that area. Thus the author, a scientist, feels he is justified in writing about painting.He finds that painting during the last half-century is too diverse for there to be a simple relation between painting and science. Most of the painting prevailing during this period has some ascertainable connexion with science. Man will never reach finality in his scientific attempts to express his understanding of the world, nor will painters cease to explore new ways of creating aesthetically valuable objects which reflect the ways in which the nature of the physical and social world enters their intelligence and feelings.He points out that the natural sciences and painting, although related in some ways, are quite different in their essential aims. Artists judge the basic importance of their work by applying a totally different criterion from that which is used by a scientist. Nevertheless, man cannot produce anything which has solely an aesthetic impact and no conceptual meaning; nor can he produce anything that is purely scientific without providing any basis from which aesthetic creation is possible.With the cracking of the atom, consideration must be made of the world as made of things much more like vertebrates\u2014soft on the outside, but with a solid skeleton structure within. The challenge one might throw out to painters is, how far can they express the underlying hard skeletal structure without sacrificing the great advances they have made in exhibiting the softness of the immediately apparent outside of the fundamental elements of our experience. Because for science both are equally essential.But the author says it would be a mistake to see the traffic between art and science as a one-way affair. Science, of course, cannot expect to learn scientific truths from the productions of artists, any more than the latter can get much profit from merely taking over the superficial appearance of intellectual concepts of science. But a scientist by looking at paintings or experiencing other kinds of art, can loosen the joints of his psyche and give himself a chance to dredge up from the obscure internal depths something\u2014which will probably not have the slightest obvious connexion with the work of art he has been contemplating\u2014which may be fresh enough to be worth while.", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, "Le droit \u00e0 la \u2018personnalit\u00e9\u2019 est le plus grand privil\u00e8ge moderne.

By eliminating many of the generally accepted but superficial answers to these questions, one soon discovers that a scientist is seeking to learn something different from what can be inferred from previous knowledge, something leading ultimately to a new perception of the wholeness, beauty and harmony in the order and structure of natural process. Such a perception is akin to what is sought, although in a very different way, by the artist, the musician, the architect, and indeed by all who are engaged in truly creative action.Nevertheless, it is necessary to be more precise about what is meant by the notion of creativity. What is order? What is structure? What is process? In this article, these questions are considered, and certain answers are suggested, at least in a provisional way. The meanings of these suggestions are brought out in several examples, drawn mainly from the actual history of the development of science, but not entirely restricted to this field.The question is then raised as to what is preventing the vast majority of human beings from being really creative, except perhaps on rather rare occasions. Further discussion suggests that in a way, the creative possibilities of the mind are generally dormant. This state of \u2018sleep\u2019 is probably the result of a very widespread and deep confusion between the creative and the mechanical. As a result of this confusion it is very hard even to perceive that one is not creative.The essay concludes with a brief discussion of what it would mean to be free of this confusion, and how such freedom might perhaps come into being.", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]
